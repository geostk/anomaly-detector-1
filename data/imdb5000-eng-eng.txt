Or maybe this film will inspire you to help others.
The take on lawyers is also superb.
His character is more malevolent than usual.
This is easily the most underrated film inn the Brooks cannon.
Many of the jokes fall flat.
This is not the typical Mel Brooks film.
It rates a 7.
Yes its an art.
to successfully make a slow paced thriller.
The story unfolds in nice volumes while you do not even notice it happening.
Fine performance by Robin Williams.
The direction is good.
Use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and unexpectedness is good.
Williams returns to New York.
A scene or two establishing their relationship might have helped set the stage.
She is that good.
I liked the film.
I especially liked the opening scene which had a semi truck in it.
A very tense action scene that seemed well done.
Also the film is funny is several parts.
I also liked how the evil guy was portrayed too.
I would give the film an 8 out of 10.
I enjoyed The Night Listener very much.
Robin Williams gives one of his best performances.
Sandra Oh adds a wonderful comic touch.
Everyone is very believable.
I wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the movie.
Do not be sucker punched by the previews and ads.
See The Night Listener because you want to see a good story told well.
If you go expecting Hitchcock you will be disappointed.
My only complaint with the movie was the ending.
I can guarantee you that you have never seen this kind of movie before.
This is no americanized movie.
Neither is it a predictable movie.
I just kept waiting for it to get better.
Something that makes you jump off your seat.
I will leave it at that.
Toni Collette also stars.
The production felt rushed and holes are apparent.
It certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort.
The book is probably better.
I found that there were so many perfect choices made.
and for the last number of years.
This Night Listener is better than people are generally saying.
Give it a shot.
This is the token moody period Gothic horror entry from the bunch.
A real campy hoot.
Watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room.
An act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced.
This has got to be a unique twists of two genres of ever seen.
The giant monster movie genre with the living mummy movie genre.
This unique blend makes for a unique and compelling story.
The acting was wonderful.
I give THE FALLEN ONES 9 OUT OF 10.
It looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance.
The charismatic Miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable.
I am sure this movie will always be in my top 5.
The acting is superb.
I do not think anyone could have a better job than Kate.
Titanic is the greatest movie of the 21st Century.
There is nothing wrong with this movie.
Apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time.
The script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard.
It just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key moments.
95 would be an acceptable price for the film.
Which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it.
Not that Titanic has none of that.
But the reason Titanic works is that it is such an emotional ride.
And look at the top ten grossing films of all time.
And this movie made 1.
8 BILLION DOLLARS worldwide.
It can not be bad.
no one will remember it in 50 years.
It was so touching and beautiful.
I strongly recommend seeing for all.
Could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece.
It will be almost impossible.
The director no doubt had the major impact on the film.
The movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling.
Everything looks very real and live.
The acting was the real effect.
No one could have done better.
They are partly the reason why the film is so great.
I guess it is not too much to talk about.
I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving.
It was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever.
In the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears.
The story is simple and it works.
She calls and tells her tale on the RMS Titanic.
Everything about the story works and there are very few flaws.
Rose almost commits suicide but the Gilbert Grape star rescues her.
I really liked the hanging over the boat scene.
It was a good risk.
However I think it is unfair to say that they are terrible actors.
Titanic is a classic.
When the movie came out people flocked to the theaters.
It was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason.
They trusted each other.
They sure as hell are giving Romeo and Juliet a run for their money.
It really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie.
For me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time.
He sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film.
But Titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance.
The music has become iconic and legendary.
My heart will not go on from this one.
Jack and Rose return to the top deck.
Leonardo DiCaprio is terrific on screen with big charisma.
He keeps a 56 carat blue diamond worn by Louis XVI.
The decor is overwhelming.
One for the ages.
Everything of the time was very formal.
Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes.
Technically the film is very well done.
PEOPLE make the film a huge success.
I avoided watching this film for the longest time.
One of the girls spoke about this movie.
I shared my feelings with my fellow judges.
The movie must have done something right to get her so interested.
Then it finally appeared on Pay TV.
My high school public speaking contestant was right.
The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world.
This is truly an excellent movie.
It is the most amazing love story ever attempted.
I will gladly side with the majority this time around.
And they are too embarrassed now to admit it.
in all the same places.
You look like an out of touch cynic.
No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults.
Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation.
James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic.
How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me.
I was utterly transfixed.
This film is one memorable scene after another.
Titanic leaving port in Southampton.
The screams of the doomed after she went down.
And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears.
And the love theme was beautiful and tragic.
The film was made with such humanity.
This is a movie teenagers should watch.
Maybe that way they will start appreciating the value of family again.
He should be offered more serious roles.
This movie can be appreciated by people of all ages.
Because it portrays the values that are important in life.
It just may be haunted.
A crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film.
The tracking and the cuts need to be slow.
The performances help create tension.
But neither menace is really the point.
The point is human relationships.
There are a number of character arcs that are very interesting.
How disappointing to have it end.
Every character was important and did a fabulous job carrying their role.
I would have loved to see each character develop over the years.
Yes it touched my heart.
Family problems abound in real life and that is what this movie is about.
ALL the actors portraying their characters did outstanding performances.
A must see for those who care about their families.
The cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years.
Anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much.
I think this movie was way ahead of its time.
I have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here.
This is a film.
Fine acting and directing.
Watching this film made me remember my first love.
Highly recommended for all film lovers.
I plan on trying to get a copy of it myself to watch.
The story is very touching and I would recommend it to anyone.
This is a movie for the whole family despite its rating.
This is a movie I will show to my children.
She was such a great actor for being so little.
but she really seemed to be in character perfectly.
which is just so heartwarming after all the mishaps in the movie.
The two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context.
This movie is the best film ever.
Little girl liked to be his granddaughter and King of Masks liked a grandson.
They were not conventional in real.
Every scene they were together was priceless.
The camera work is flawless and grips you.
The acting is inspired.
He played his helpful and kindhearted character extremely well.
I can not recommend this film enough.
The whole film is in loops.
Everything has a significance.
It just keeps changing its mood like its protagonist changes his face.
Last scene on the rope is phenomenal.
Story and script is flawless.
Both the protagonists are artists you can tell the way they have performed.
It was not even nominated for Oscars.
The young girl is an amazing talent.
The original Chinese dialog heightens the emotional intensity of the performances and the story.
What a wonderful film.
The acting is sublime.
The filming is pleasant and the environment is keenly realistic.
It seemed worthwhile to experience.
Acting is solid enough.
Thematically puerile but still rich enough to compliment the vehicle of its expression.
The story is absorbing.
The setting is serene and the costuming simple.
But do not get me started on that.
This movie was excellent.
A sad truth to how culture tends to clash with the sexes.
This is just one big warm fuzzy type of movie.
This equals on big happy movie in the end.
Bound to be in Oscar contention for best foreign film.
A welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies.
And I think they did pretty well with this.
There are many stories inside this one.
An unexpected pleasure as I had heard nothing about this film.
Shameful since it warrants having a wider audience.
Solidly acted by the principals.
Master Wang is sold a son by a slave trader.
All is well as he joyfully prepares to pass down his art.
But the son eventually is found out to be a girl.
This is a wonderful film for children as well as adults.
Beautiful and touching movie.
I never saw such an interesting setting when I was in China.
This is probably my favorite movie of all time.
It is perfection in its storytelling.
Street entertainer catching the attention of famous opera star and friendship ensuing.
I was happy to see the Shaw Brothers are still producing good films.
The story is simple.
The faces of the actors are marvelous to see.
A round device that creates a wormhole.
It gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds.
I find that great.
Blockbuster has it rated as though it were an X rated movie.
This deserves a lot better treatment.
and the problems that ensue afterward.
The rest of the story is how the two manage after that.
This spectacular film is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen.
I simply can not recommend this movie highly enough.
It may just change you forever once you have seen it.
It shows Taylor at the height of her beauty.
Thank goodness Dana Andrews is around to save the day.
One of my favorite guilty pleasures.
Atlantis is still going strong on its 4th seasons.
Such craftsmanship reveals the careful attention to detail that these men sought.
My parents took me to this movie when I was nine years old.
I have never forgotten it.
I had never before seen anything as beautiful as Elizabeth Taylor.
The soundtrack of the English version is also very good.
I wonder if they ever made a soundtrack album of that.
The subtleties are truly out of this world and the characterization is beyond brilliant.
I do have some complaints though.
Uneven in places but still a lot of fun.
Or couch for that matter either.
I am very picky with my selections.
Stick with it and you will see what I'm talking about.
Then went and bought both acts.
They were even better than I had experienced at first.
Hope it is not lost.
They had to be that good to play that demented.
I like it and recommend it for movie lovers of all ages.
I have not seen another movie like this.
You can not not be impressed by this movie.
A treat to all avid fans of Indian cinema.
A man forced to join a career of a cop by his cop father.
Recommended to all who are interested in nostalgia of serious Hindi films.
Till this movie was made there was no audience for documentaries in India.
Each one played their part par excellence.
His father is a harsh Police Constable.
His compromise towards unethical practice is negative.
Finally he gets suspended.
The Practical approach of Script is a major Punch.
Those aspects are dealt brilliantly.
Words fall short for this great work.
This movie has stood the test of times.
Thus this movie was truly a trend setter.
This trend dominated the Hindi movie scene for more than a decade.
This movie was a moderate box office hit.
This is a very good and a classic film.
Its also interesting how each character is practically the opposite of the other.
Id say though that it turned out just fine.
The Haunted World of Edward D.
Documentary about the infamous Edward D.
covering his life and movies.
There are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him.
Interviews are mixed with clips from the movies or some bizarre recreations.
Wood had ambitions but not a bit of talent to carry them out.
Still it is of interest if you are a Wood fan.
I loved this film.
Not being a swooning Ed Wood Jr.
could not be condensed to a single viewpoint.
This collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we can ever get.
Best watched at 3 am while wearing an angora sweater.
The film puts the atrocity into context of the time.
It also shows the savagery of the soldiers on the day of the atrocity.
An excellent and accurate film.
McGovern takes great pains to research and document his writing and it pays off.
Never before seen such a sick and twisted thing.
The Story is good and the actors do their thing very well.
It just all theoretically possible and exciting.
7 or 8 out of 10.
I do not want to give away too much.
The pilot is extremely well done.
It lays out how the characters bond in future episodes.
I do not think anyone could have created a better pilot for this show.
It displays remarkable creativity on the writers part.
I would love to get a copy of it.
Thanks for the assistance.
It just seemed to be believable.
thanks for the hours of entertainment you have provided over the years.
Proper grammar and pronunciation are essential to a film.
However Abby has other plans of her own.
There are also various assorted body parts.
for those with the stomach.
The atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling.
Well its about time.
At the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation.
Abbey has caught Cliff cheating and he is desperately trying to win her back.
And this is just the setup people.
A man and his wife get in a horrible car accident.
My apologies to him for my underestimation.
but this is easily the best episode of the season.
but they may someday end up being masters in the future.
I liked this one a lot.
Do NOT watch whilst eating pudding.
But the fun is in the journey.
then you want a thriller.
This is a romantic comedy.
This is a really old fashion charming movie.
And While You Were Sleeping.
The rest of the cast is fun.
And that is what makes it fun to watch.
The two leads always have to get together.
I liked all the NY characters and I loved the locations.
then this is for you.
This was a great movie.
Her smile is radiant and her beauty can not be disguised.
I do not understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them.
I guess we see what we want to see.
I think you will like it.
A beautiful postcard of New York.
My teenagers liked it too.
This film told a story that felt comfortable but not old or done.
The ending came with a twist which we all liked too.
I recommend it and we need more of these films to watch.
Anybody who appreciates a romantic Movie SHOULD SEE IT.
I caught this film at a test screening.
Was very surprised to find a really sweet and fun story.
Takes place in the best locations in New York.
Made me want to go there.
It was clean and great for whole family.
I think it will do well.
Audience I saw it with loved it.
He sure can and is likable in this movie.
I just can not understand the negative comments about this film.
Thanks Fox for producing it.
The actor who played Jesus was miscast.
I would love to buy the CD.
There are few films or movies I consider favorites over the years.
The Gospel road was one of them.
Besides I am a Johnny Cash fan and it was a brave venture.
I came out surprised and very amused.
She had amazing comedic timing.
And its depiction of contemporary L.
Never before has a movie made L.
We already know the public taste leans heavily toward the mediocre.
I think it had it all.
It made me laugh out loud over a dozen of times.
I think it is a shame it only scored 5.
This had a good story.
it had a nice pace and all characters are developed cool.
Good job in writing.
This is a great film.
I agreed to watch a chick flick and some how ended up with this.
Actually my vote is a 7.
Rock won with his movie.
overall it was actually better then i expected but not by much.
a typical romantic comedy with its moments i guess.
The characters are all funny.
They work together very well.
The real match up is Paul Rudd and Lake Bell.
Over Her Dead Body was a nice little movie.
I do not see how this movie was bad.
I could have dealt with a 5.
I have always looked forward to new episodes with great anticipation.
Snafu shorts were actually quite funny.
It stands up as one of the best of the Private Snafu shorts.
The setting is an Army camp.
This is a highly effective piece of work.
A good way to lose a war is demoralize the enemy.
This cartoon may be 65 years old but it sure has relevance today.
People forget that war could have easily wound up with the other side winning.
It was a tense time.
A surprise emotional ending.
When you will leave the cinema you will be moved.
Especially the opening moments are terrific.
Egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman.
The movie is chronological in a way.
A surprise emotional ending.
When you will leave the cinema you will be moved.
But after few episodes I became a fan.
Struggling to the end when all hope is lost.
This is as authentic a scene you can get in rural India.
All said and done this is one good Movie.
although other movies are not far behind.
one man that will never ever disappoint you.
The sets were also pretty good.
And that is when the problems start.
She is sure to win awards for this heated portrayal.
This picture has everything any movie could ever have.
Yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performance.
The movie is not without its share of realism.
Then things go terribly wrong.
Her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible.
The movie was disturbing at moments.
What is most ironic is this is probably her weakest written role to date.
The other good performance was the little kid.
The movie was probably saved desperately by their performances.
This disc is NOT for the faint of heart.
This is the Who at their most powerful.
The Original Drum and Bass.
This concert footage for me is one of their best.
The crowed went wild.
not to mention acting like an Old West gunslinger.
His great vision and creativity really helped this film.
Some of the camera shots in the film were done very well.
I certainly will not be raving about the story of this film.
The dialect and lifestyle details are accurately reminiscent of this region of the Philippines.
I played it a zillion times during Spring 1993 with my friend Andrew.
Then Streets of Rage 2 came out.
And we quickly forgot that this one even existed.
You even have the chance to become Mr.
Streets of Rage also has truly fantastic music.
Easy to get into and hard to put down.
Baddies often walk away from you instead of engaging in combat.
This is especially infuriating with the Level 5 boss.
Lack of combo moves.
Lack of decent weapons.
Bad guy models are repeated far too often.
Davis as Major General George S.
And sometimes not even then.
All i hear about is how poorly the animation is done.
I hope for a sequel very soon.
I do not think Lady Death would transfer well to film.
Then she seeks revenge.
and the rest you better see it from the movie.
If the movies got anymore awesome.
I would have her babies.
And I am female.
Read the comics you will not regret it.
Yes in this movie since Brian P.
the artist for her died we do not get nearly as good artistic work.
Different Strokes for different folks as the saying goes.
Why everyone else hates that is beyond me.
Character development was fine.
I like how they brought the transition from Hope to Lady Death around.
his dark bruiting style was perfect for this kind of movie.
Gotta find a copy somewhere.
I would have preferred that New Yorker Films had translated the title directly.
This film has renewed my interest in French cinema.
All these incidents cause other events that .
But then this is the magic world of cinema.
Stranger things have happened.
The subtitles quite annoyingly gave both parts of a dialog at once.
This occurs in the first few minutes of the film.
All of that is interesting enough.
That kept me guessing for a while.
A chance meeting at the metro sets the tone for the film.
The best part of the movie comes with about 20 minutes left.
The ending to this movie is top notch.
Some folks might think that was an improvement.
These psychological thrillers are less entertainment than some kind of remote therapy.
This one is a pip.
Meanwhile the rest of the family schemes to sabotage the romance.
The results are predictable.
You get a little bit of everything in this movie.
Sexual tension between the sisters.
A little subtle masochism.
One or two of the actors sound vaguely familiar.
The acting is so bad it is hard to believe.
It was shot in and around LA mostly at night and probably without permits.
The end was so bizarre that I thought it was a joke.
That hilarious line is typical of what these naughty sisters say.
The other is got up to look like Marilyn Monroe.
All three sisters are played by starlets.
He had something of a career.
He also is shown sopping wet in a swimsuit.
The movie is not bad.
I truly do not know where it was shown.
The women are scantily dressed.
But the guy seems to be the central focus.
And I think the audience is meant to also.
Make sure to catch it when broadcast.
The perplexing ending is actually quite consistent with the rest of the film.
and I DO mean it.
But rarely a movie worth watching is actually rated under 6.
The movie is not perfect.
Its true rating should be an 8 or a 9.
The best reason to watch was on the Elvira show a few years back.
Elvira delivered the movie with as many laughs as one can.
I was around 7 when I saw this movie first.
Most yeti pictures are fatally undermined by a grave paucity of energy and enthusiasm.
I saw it at a midnight screening in L.
You are the best.
Stargate is the best show ever.
All the actors are absolutely perfect for there roles.
I love the connection between the characters.
If you have not seen this show I very highly recommend it.
Vote 7 and half out of 10.
Instead these guys fight to the death with brutal results.
Several horses get chopped up.
The production is very impressive and the setting is bleak.
Just remember it is not child friendly.
Sadly this has not been true of the films he has made in Hollywood.
I used to LOVE this movie when I was little and I still do.
And It proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed.
This show has been my escape from reality for the past ten years.
I will sadly miss it.
Although Atlantis has filled the hole a small bit.
Robert wrote something that felt close to reality.
From episode one I was hooked.
It has inspired me to do many things that I thought was impossible.
I never want the show to die.
The voice acting for me was what made the movie.
I found it more interesting than that.
This movie has to be my favorite of all time.
or at least I hope that his movies sucked because of these limitations.
This movie is banned in just about every foreign country I can think of.
Just 3 men torturing a woman for about 45 minutes.
The worst is the eye scene.
So I popped this sucker in and sat down.
This ended up not being the case.
The film fails to shock.
The characters had become stale as well.
Colonel Jack O'Neill was the stereotypical hero with emotional baggage.
only allowing his close friends in.
Amanda Tapping joined the cast as Captain Samantha Carter.
Christopher Judge has done quite a bit with a limited character.
He is also a rock.
Davis has done an incredible job with Hammond making him sympathetic and normal.
If not allowed by his superiors to provide troops to support teams off world.
He will go himself.
This gave him confidence.
He still monitors the groups ethics.
He still is lead at providing information that can move any mission forward.
Definitely different from her soldier like character Arin Soon.
I have seen all the guinea pigs and this one is easily the best.
Another movie I'm hiding from my parents.
This movie has no story.
Although I was disgusted by this movie i really liked it.
I guess it fills some kind of purpose.
I have seen the short movie a few years ago.
After that I watch all sequels.
I have already watch the making of Guinea Pig 1.
Also the sequels are excellent in the special effects.
however the scenes with the pinching and the hot oil look very real.
My name is Steve and I run Unearthed Films.
I'm writing this review because I love the Guinea Pig films.
I have seen it all.
from every underground cult sensation to every Hollywood blockbuster.
This review is for the Devils Experiment.
I find it devoid of story which is fine by me.
The Devils Experiment not only delivers but that is all it is.
Why do people bash it.
It make em feel better about themselves.
We all want blood and gore.
My view is biased cause were releasing them but then again it is not.
The Devils Experiment is NOT for everybody.
What happens next was always unpredictable.
They are simply fun to watch.
Just the ultimate masterpiece in my opinion.
It just keeps getting better and better.
Definitely worth a shot.
You are never sure of who is exactly who in this movie.
This is both a quality and a drawback of the script.
As the movie ends you feel that the story lacks a bit of consistency.
But all this is largely compensated by the excellent psychological development.
This is definitely one of the best movies about gambling.
all the while building the story.
I enjoyed this show for two reasons 1.
Richard Dean Anderson 2.
The chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous.
This relationship carries over into the program we get to see.
You watch the others roll their eyes in dismay at some of his utterances.
He understands what to do without having to think about the matter.
The quality declined markedly in seasons 9 and 10.
Amanda Tapping was phoning in her performances these two seasons.
You could see her greatly changed appearance after having a baby.
She was probably thinking more about the child than the show.
The major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original.
The use of torches for illumination in these ships is just as bad.
I wondered about some of the continuity on the show too.
The patient was in on the con from the beginning.
This is very nearly a perfect film.
It has a definite Hitchcock slant to it.
ten year later perhaps.
Here she gets involved with Joe Mantegna.
I loved this series at first.
I thought it was all brilliant.
I loved them all.
Not a big deal.
It is a worthy successor to this brilliant series.
Davis died a few weeks ago.
It is a great loss.
House of Games is spell binding.
There are few movies I have seen that can grip you so quickly.
From the opening scene this movie just gets you.
From the moment the movie is over it begs to be replayed.
Joe Mantegna was also wonderful.
At least in the beginning.
With the arrival of Mantegna things pick up.
The camera is very cinematic.
The best chunk is in the middle.
I will admit the setup is pretty improbable.
To say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense.
Some have complained that Dr.
House of Games is a wonderful movie at multiple levels.
It is a fine mystery and a shocking thriller.
At this level it does succeed admirably.
House of Games sticks to its business.
As usual you really ought to see this film in a movie theater.
It should be a natural for film festivals.
Nominate it for one near you if you get the chance.
Better she should see it on a TV than not at all.
An extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings.
And nothing is what it seems.
I will watch it again and again.
Bruce is a guy who is unhappy with his life.
God comes to Bruce and grants him Godly powers.
Bruce uses these powers to get everything he has always wanted.
This movie was inspirational and deep.
This is one of those movies that they did too much promoting for.
If you watch T.
Just do not go see this movie expecting to be surprised.
I absolutely loved this movie.
It met all expectations and went beyond that.
It also had a message.
This movie had me laughing and crying.
It also sends a message that we should all know and learn from.
If you liked liar liar you will love this movie.
What better comic genius to remind us of that than Jim Carry.
Morgan Freeman was just right as God.
My biggest complaint is that they should have used more biblical references.
Bruce Almighty was enjoyable.
Eight out of ten stars.
The only purpose this movie has is to make the viewer laugh several times.
I laughed out loud and left with a smile.
This movie is very entertaining though.
The movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance.
In fact all the characters are great.
His character is like all of us.
Morgan Freeman made a great God.
I laughed my ASS off during Liar Liar and Ace Ventura.
Morgan Freeman makes a VERY cool God.
A very funny movie.
It was definitely worth the price of admission.
He was both funny and sad.
I am glad they made a sequel to this film.
God confronts him and show Bruce the error of his ways.
The deleted scenes are priceless.
And it is really funny.
This coherence gives the show exceptional staying power.
I found this highly amusing.
Enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies.
China O'Brien returns home to help out her dad.
Maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned.
I found it to be better than the short story it was based on.
The two try to learn a way to save her.
The ending is sad but has an interesting final moment that makes it touching.
Upon arriving he is given an injection and is curious as to why.
A nice story with a heartwarming conclusion.
And the first 20 minutes of the film only heightened that feeling of anticipation.
It has said that The Movies and Baseball both thrived during The Great Depression.
The literature of the time also flourished at all levels.
There were mediums that were ancestral to them.
The other direct ancestor was the Pulp Magazine.
Each of them was an expert in a given field.
We are also puzzled about Mr.
I can remember seeing it quite vividly.
It explains a lot of the stuff that the movie neglected to mention.
That was only the beginning of the adventure.
Unlock the gate and step through.
Ron Ely is just right as Doc.
Doc Savage does not have the extensive location work that Raiders has.
The best way to approach this film is to just RELAX and enjoy.
Overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day.
I give it 7 out of 10.
But they are very close to the feel of the pulps.
This is a VERY entertaining movie.
IT WAS NOT MADE THAT WAY.
All of the actors are obviously having fun while entertaining us.
The actors were not trying to emulate Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan.
This is NOT one of those martial arts films.
An unmissable treat for the whole family.
Ron Ely is a God.
Somerset Maugham stories which comprise the film.
The performances and attention to detail were wonderful to watch.
Both have a rather large number of somewhat cheesy accents and wonderful character actors.
The children ARE a bit tedious and could have been edited.
Again the author introduces the film and the stories.
Soon he has a whole chain of stores.
I will not describe the way Max rises to the occasion.
Culver watches as three stories among these characters play out to their conclusions.
The film ends after the court sums up.
This film delivers an effective story that stays with you once it has finished.
He betrays everything and everybody without an ounce of remorse.
The performance is one of the most chilling performances I have ever seen.
I still can not get over it.
But here she proves she up to the task of heavier drama.
Knox as the Nazi is brilliant.
He charts the course of a Nazi career.
the movie really shines in a couple of areas.
The phone conversation across the border is really memorable.
He has taken the bus to visit his son Norman is Los Angeles.
So RF attempts to reach his wife in Mexico.
I will kill him.
It ends less predictably than you would think.
There was so much that was just off.
You can find the URL in my email address above.
Say what you will about schmaltz.
It is inspiring because it is about people of noble purpose.
It can not all be blamed on Mr.
I'm not comparing George Bush to Adolph Hitler.
The movie had me laughing from start to finish.
and have no profile at all today.
It is very funny and YES very rude and hilariously all wrong.
Just as it should be.
I wish there were more films like this.
Entertaining if a little on the long side.
I found the movie and the performances fun and enjoyable.
Williams is a jewel.
There are a lot of laughs in the process.
Melvyn Douglas proved again that he had few peers in light comedy.
Joan Blondell was at the peak of her career and is a delight.
This movie is very good.
The screenplay is enchanting.
Her performance is excellent.
She brings me to go into the heart of her role.
Paul Lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family.
but the dialog is just bad at times.
but that is really about all.
I believe they were telling the truth the whole time.
U cant trust anything in the wild.
They family went through hell.
Those poor boys too young to understand what was going on around them.
As well as dealing with the lose of their little sister.
I cant believe this case went on for so long.
I think everyone should watch this.
8 out of 10.
Religious bigotry is rampant everywhere.
Australia is not immune to it.
This is a very moving motion picture with a terrific cast of actors.
Those with supporting roles are also quite good.
You will remember this movie for many years.
and they deliver in every way.
A CRY IN THE DARK far exceeded my expectations.
A Cry in the Dark is likewise clinical.
What followed was a gross miscarriage of justice.
The whole country was abuzz with whispers of a ritual killing.
A very good effort by the master of that trade.
A strong Aussie cast lend compelling support.
Truly a must for all conscientious Australians.
I found it hard to like anyone in this film.
What is infuriating is that it is not that difficult.
It is difficult enrapture an audience when you purposely deny them insights into yourself.
The story behind the movie is fascinating in and of itself.
The cast just makes it that much more appealing.
Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was inspiring.
I think she is worth all 10 or so of her Oscar nominations.
A pretty good film.
Their is more to the plot but you can find that out for yourself.
Not everyone goes into wild melodramatic hysterics to every major crisis.
It captured the themes of the story brilliantly.
Where this really stands out is the acting.
The performances are excellent.
There is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this.
I recommend this to any fellow fan of such.
Lindy Chamberlain was this woman.
She is subsequently arrested and put on trial.
Only after years in jail was he exonerated.
This is one of those movies.
It proves that people are the same the world over.
You will probably get blown away just by what you see here.
I really felt for her when Lindy was being persecuted.
It turned out to be better than I had anticipated.
Paul Lukas was certainly deserving of his Oscar.
Bette Davis shines brilliantly as the great actress and beauty she was.
Some movies seem to be made before we are ready for them.
Today these circuses have become common but that makes the lesson only more important.
The Aussie accents get a bit thick at times but not incomprehensible.
ROLL is a wonderful little film.
Parts of it reminded me of LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING Barrels.
I really want to visit Australia one day.
Some of the best filmmakers in the are Australian.
The cinematography in ROLL was especially impressive.
I loved the stylized colors and lighting in many of the scenes.
Mat is unlikely to have a quiet evening in before his big day.
Toby and Damien were well cast together and did an outstanding job.
And then things go wrong.
I have just watched Roll and what a pleasure it turned out to be.
Watch out for these two.
I am of course kidding.
He feels that FDR connived the U.
Paul Lukas deserved the Oscar he won.
They are moneyed people who could silently advance evil simply by not opposing it.
i will keep checking in.
it also has some of the same delicacy and persistent poignancy.
The previous reviewer has said it exactly.
I still remember some of the scenes.
I recall going to the library researching all that I could on this story.
I even wrote to the PBS station for more information.
There was one other bidder but I was determined to win this movie.
The losing bidder wrote me asking for a copy which I gave her.
Almost 30 years later I recall this original PBS film as almost unbearably tender.
Bo and Luke Duke help Uncle Jesse run Moonshine in the General Lee.
Coltrane was way too serious.
Back to the movie.
The real star is of course the General Lee.
The car chases and stunts are excellent and that is really what D.
And I really enjoyed this flick.
I enjoyed myself here a lot more than I did with other summer blockbusters.
And as far as the plot goes.
It was the perfect Dukes plot.
And I would have like a little bit more incompetence from Sheriff Roscoe.
In the movie Roscoe is a little.
I saw this movie when I was a child.
It blew me away.
I would recommend this movie to any and everyone.
The color was outstanding.
I even liked most of the actors in it.
Davis they would be laughed off the screen.
The possible exception is Now Voyager.
I absolutely adore this film.
Some of the back story on this production is fascinating.
This is a beautiful movie filled with adventure.
The Genii in the bottle is a classic scene.
I loved every minute of it.
A fantastic Arabian adventure.
He collects amazing toys from around the world.
And the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful.
But it is not so much their effectiveness as the audacity of the inventions.
Also impressing is the climax with its wonderful flying carpet.
Of course good gets a little help from an unlikely source.
Not a bad message to be sending out in 1940 at that.
Everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end.
Probably the finest fantasy film ever made.
Doubtless Spielberg and Lucas were enthralled by this one.
Every frame has its own magical charm.
Here is a film that will never grow old.
I have never passed up an opportunity to watch it throughout the intervening years.
This remarkable picture ranks as one of the finest fantastic films of all time.
8 out of 10.
Here is a villain worth watching.
The rest of the cast do fine work.
The two escape and take a boat to the city of Basra.
Ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden.
Then he is captured.
The Prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her.
He does awaken her.
His first is for sausages.
He has the genie take him to Ahmad.
Ahmad uses the eye to see the princess.
She smells a flower and forgets everything at once.
The production designs are just stunning in this movie.
From the palaces to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter.
The music and songs are also well done.
A wonderful film highlighting American positive propaganda against a wicked foe.
Rex Ingram made me believe in genies.
He set the bar very high.
I watch this movie at least twice a year.
and never tire of it.
This film is an adventure for all ages.
I was ten years old the first time I saw it and the U.
was just about to enter WWII.
Yet they fit into the story well.
The effects fit with the script.
Everything is just so beautiful.
The sets are beautiful.
Those effects still work their charm.
The giant genie is ably acted by Rex Ingram.
Butler and Tom Howard.
Both men had long and distinguished careers in technical wizardry.
This is one of the best of its kind.
I have to agree with MR.
Lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this work.
Lukas fought in Spain on the Republican side and was wounded there.
His health has not been the same since.
His family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes.
Those decisions affect all the other members of the cast.
The MGM art and music departments also did a good job.
Also notice that Ms.
This is a most handsome film.
There is precious little in the story line that relates to actual events.
These web sites can be located by using any good search engine.
There are also several books available concerning his life history.
He was singing Jose in Carmen in San Francisco the night of the earthquake.
His acting is natural and genuine.
And why should it.
To say that liberties were taken with his life is to be modest.
His contribution to the recording industry is treated as almost an afterthought.
The result was a wonderful movie.
I like it because of my recent personal experience.
Especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite.
The movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory.
Before Sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head.
The end was not quite important after all.
Movies are supposed to be enjoyable.
This is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it.
I am on a journey too.
The movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions.
But will this newfound relationship last past sunrise.
I am now restless waiting for the weekend so I can see the sequel.
Will soften even the hardiest heart.
I'm not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies but heard this was good.
Easily the most romantic thing I have ever seen in my life.
The chemistry is flawless as is the writing and directing.
You can not look away nor can you stop listening to them.
Even the little moments just melt your heart.
On the train he met a French girl Celine.
Then the romantic story unfolded.
At first they were cautious.
The funniest scene was their listening to CD in music store.
Their deep love for each other was expressed completely by words.
Love is a strange thing.
Love needs mutual understanding.
Spiritual harmony is the most important for love.
Excellent screenplay and performance resulted in huge success of the movie.
One of the best romance movies.
the most amazing combination of love and psyche of two young people.
presented in the most sublime manner and definitely touches your heart.
the movie re affirms your faith in love and pain of separation.
the joy of seeing your most beloved is unparalleled and anything can be sacrificed.
A must see movie for all the people who believe in true love.
What the actors bring out is what becomes of them .
right or wrong even the idea bearers would find it difficult to justify.
This is a slow moving story.
I really mean that.
Still it did not ruin the movie.
The dialog is fascinating.
The build up to the finale is satisfying and in the end rewarding.
Krebs of the nineties.
I was totally satisfied with the outcome and everything else.
But it certainly spoke to me.
They must have improvised during some parts and it works well.
They have a great chemistry in their roles.
I get the feeling that this was a very personal work for Mr.
It definitely touched me and I hope it touches others just as much.
Of course my favorite character was the Grandmother played by Lucile Watson.
But I loved the way Betty Davis and her family was portrayed.
did not act like children in the slightest.
This movie is intelligent.
The actors play absolutely brilliantly.
Balancing on this fine line demands outrageously talented actors.
This is simply a gem of a movie that you can not miss.
The dialog is perfect.
They talk and fall in love.
This is a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one viewing.
See it and it may change your way of life.
i watched this movie 10 years ago.
and have watched it on video an average of once a year since.
We are too afraid to check that out.
It does not strike me as totally wrong.
Few can claim that.
It has dialog with bite in it.
And what it says is quite true.
It also has moments of near poetry.
Hellman could write very well at times.
Dialog and acting are great.
I love the characters and their ideas and thoughts.
But that is not the point.
Their story is what we ever wanted and probably most of us never reached.
This was so clever and touching.
I want to go to Vienna.
I want to see them as soon as possible again.
They are both masterpieces.
I'm sorry for my English which i m trying to best.
My vote is ten.
Before Sunrise is romance for the slacker generation.
Adding to the beauty of the film is the city of Vienna.
Before Sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating.
Before Sunrise is what it is.
This movie focuses purely on watching the budding of a beautiful romance.
What makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is.
This is exactly they way you would dream that you meet that special someone.
It just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that the film suggests.
One can not help but be touched deeply by looking at this movie.
We have several dimensions of love that contributes to the value of this movie.
There is the divine love of God that is beautifully portrayed.
There is the love in a marriage.
He knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated.
Talk to someone and let them know you love them.
Love does no good unless it is given to another.
this movie has a real feel to it.
Give this film your full attention and its message will truly inspire.
Her leftist views were not well regarded at the time in the country.
The adaptation is credited to Ms.
They are crossing the border to the United States from Mexico.
They are to continue toward Mrs.
We find out that Mr.
The film offers excellent acting all around.
This was a good film with a powerful message of love and redemption.
Loved the film and it brought tears to my eyes.
A Vow to Cherish is a wonderful movie.
The main characters experience inner struggles and cope with extremely hard decisions.
I know that it may seem a bit idealistic.
Ken Howard is also memorable as the faithful husband.
But nobody forces you to do so.
The ending is very predictable but satisfying.
She displays a knack for comedy as well as an ability to do drama.
The mechanics of the film are a lot of fun too.
The camera displays sophisticated late silent techniques like mobility.
The title cards are also incredibly clever.
I remember seeing promos for this show before it appeared back in 1993.
I will tell you a tale of the summer of 1994.
Desmond Howl had it all.
Canadian cinema suffers from several problems.
who are now still trying to become adults.
and they are having such a hard time adjusting to a regular life.
as they see the new bands etc getting the spotlight.
it is almost like they have to begin anew.
and that is where I find the film sad and depressing.
and she is one lady in a film you will cheer for.
This is an almost perfect movie.
sad but in a way positive.
because of the whales.
I do not know why.
I was in a bad frame of mind when I first saw this movie.
I was amazingly impressed by this movie.
He finds a companion who comes with her own issues.
Des is an unlikely character by todays standards of a rock star.
Yet he has musical genius.
Claire is the streetwise kid that needs a place to stay.
She finds hidden talents while being in Des company.
She also finds a mutual friend that accepts her.
She learns to trust him over a period of time.
These two find love with one another.
two of them in fact.
The bailiff comes by to tell her that she is in a huge debt.
I thought my jawbones would burst.
The acting was outstanding in this movie.
He just cracks me up.
Watch this movie if you ever get a chance.
This is an hilarious movie.
It can also make you laugh so hard your health will improve.
I love this film.
Either would have killed the film completely.
The music was good though not great but filled out the movie nicely.
Her dearly departed has left her with no money and outstanding debts.
Craig Ferguson is equally amiable as Matthew.
The film is thoroughly likable and always amusing.
The supporting cast also does a fine job.
The premise alone is appealing.
And the film plays around with the premise wisely every now and then.
You just might feel more than a little festive after seeing it.
This light hearted comedy should be enjoyed for entertainment value.
The cast of characters meld well together and are quite believable in their roles.
How Grace handles meeting her dead husbands girlfriend was well played.
The last five minutes cost it 2 points in my rating.
I saw Saving Grace right after it came out on video.
The characters are what makes the movie so good.
You will love it.
This film was brilliant.
It was beautifully acted in the more serious scenes and the funny moments were .
I just thought it was excellent and I still do.
Sisters in law will be released theatrically on march 24th in Sweden.
A good occasion for our Nordic friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary.
Games with this much replay value are few and far between.
Super Mario 64 is undoubtedly the greatest game ever created.
but I hope to achieve them eventually.
The controls are great.
The Bowser fights are challenging.
good for playing in short bursts of time.
I heard that Luigi and Yoshi are in the game towards the end.
The characters are really great.
Especially for it is time.
I found the graphics in the water courses very very good.
This is my favorite part of the game.
Or at least one of the best.
It beats out mediocre Super Mario Sunshine any day.
I have played this game plenty of times and its good every time.
This game is amazing.
Although it is ancient now it was amazing when it came out.
I believe that this game will always be a classic.
You can spend four hours in one level.
You enter the world by going through a painting.
10 out of 10.
There is brief language in this.
I recommend this to any fan of romance stories.
I only hope this film gets a wide release in the United States.
My biggest criticism is the scenery.
It is far too lush.
England has never been like this.
It looks like a chocolate box.
Only Americans would make it like this.
Despite these criticisms I enjoyed this film but would recommend the TV adaptation more.
I wish she had read a little more.
She will hopefully be around for a real long time.
It is one of those old stories that are still accurate those days.
I specially like it when she sings a duet.
I thought you overqualified.
The film is though for some reason very entertaining and I loved it.
Her growing romance with the unparalleled Mr.
Knightly with his poise and nobility.
This is a powerful documentary about domestic abuse in the Cameroon.
And the movie they made deserves a wide audience.
a really enjoyable and deserving movie.
The acting is competent.
Emma is a true romance.
He makes and excellent romantic lead.
It enhances the movie to heights that are extraordinary.
They nearly steal the show.
But it is with characters like Emma that she really shines.
And that is the magic of the movies.
Emma is that movie.
One of the beaten wives also is seeking a divorce.
The outcomes in each case are favorable to the women and children.
This is a highly important and well made film.
What a delightful film.
Toni Collette was great as Harriett Smith.
One of the most endearing characters I have come across in ages.
From one of the opening scenes when she is thanking Mr.
I hope that this film delights you all as much as it has myself.
I love this movie.
This movie is definitely on my top 10 list of good movies.
Make the World go away.
Get it off my shoulder.
Then they start to improve their live by hating away memories.
The sound effects during this were great.
Things really got weird at the end.
It just has to be seen.
the only word that sums up this movie is quirky.
8 out of ten.
I was in for a surprise.
without working that hard.
People complain about the movie being too simple or too boring.
The judges waste no time in lashing out at the woman with fury.
The two leads are great and really carry the film.
This should become a cult favorite.
I thought this was an awesome movie.
It was very weird and unrealistic.
The big cable company is mainly what I'm talking about.
Everything fit together well.
The plain white cover and title intrigued me.
it would have done very well indeed.
It had the audience laughing the whole time.
See it if you can.
I would love to write some more but am on quite a time limit.
However I encourage anyone and everyone to give this film a try.
They live in a strange looking house beneath two freeways.
They are left alone.
They have chemistry and also work very well.
Keep your eyes peeled for this guy.
but it won me over by the end.
just do not ask me to explain it.
And of course that is exactly what happens.
The rest of the story places Dave and Andrew in this world of nothingness.
The entire world of nothing is white.
white no matter in what direction you look.
This is the weakness of this film.
One of the best parts of the film is the set.
Nothing features digital visual effects and prosthetics that equals any modern horror film.
We do not know where they are or what has happened to them.
You will be glad you did.
But that is where even more problems begin.
Just say you hate it and why you hate it.
The direction of the mass scenes in the rehearsal rooms was enormously well done.
The story never really got lost in this frantic pace.
These sequences got a lot a chuckles from the audience as well.
All in all a great film with a sour ending.
The ice cream cone is invented in New York.
Got to be a new record.
And he could dance.
Basically he was a leading man in the body of a character actor.
Such energy and vitality.
I thought I was just going to be rewarded with a small headache.
One of the last releases before the Motion Picture Production Code was strictly enforced.
Gentility and morality made sure of it.
Chester has trouble with people trying to steal his ideas for his shows.
This is a very entertaining film with lots of comedy and plenty of laughs.
One of the best musicals ever.
I would love to know.
How anyone can say this is bad is beyond me.
I loved this show before I even saw it.
Jessica Alba and 3.
The girls are sure game.
They come up smiling with water in their eyes and still hit their marks.
The whole thing must have been incredibly difficult and exhausting.
a human picture forms of Franklin Roosevelt and the NRA eagle.
The movie is full of juicy clichés that make us smile.
And it needs to be said that he was not bad at it.
He plays the role with a lot of confidence.
So do the characters and actors that are portraying them.
Once again the musical numbers also feature a young Billy Barty.
A recommendable early genre movie.
But we always have the movies as a way to escape our troubles.
Apparently Blondell was the only other woman who Cagney loved apart from his wife.
And you can see the mutual adoration in every scene.
This is a wonderful film.
The musical productions of Busby Berkeley will never be duplicated.
I think this movie easily outdoes all of his other efforts.
Joan Blondell and James Cagney are incredible together.
Cagney is always terrific.
I do not understand the John Garfield issue though.
I found it on Turner Classics.
I found it by wonderful accident.
But this is a pretty strange movie.
After a while it gets a bit too much.
But none of them really mean anything.
Cagney and Blondell have excellent chemistry and their scenes go off really well.
From that point of view it is utter fantasy.
I will gladly watch this film again and again and again and.
But it is all in fun.
7 out of 10.
Herman Bing is hilarious in his one tiny scene as a music arranger.
These are all scenes from a 1933 musical.
Kent is basically an idea man along the lines of choreographer Busby Berkeley.
It has a story.
She is the perfect partner for James Cagney .
Those behind the curtains were hit as bad as those in front.
Some other competitors get wind of it and the competition is on.
But it is so creative and fun to watch.
John Garfield is seen briefly in the Shanghai Lil number.
I think the brothers Warner were playing a little joke there.
I have got to believe that clip was deliberate.
Note the African guys mixed into the scene with white and Asian prostitutes.
Here the black guys are sitting at the bar and singing with the others.
wholeheartedly supported the uplift dictated by the F.
In a few months the Production Code would eliminate such naughty pleasures.
The overall effect is highly erotic and mesmerizing.
A thoroughly enjoyable Depression era romp.
A dark fable for adults.
I hope that a box set of Longstreet will appear.
I also believe that Dark Angel will become a cult favorite.
Thus enabling them to continue their struggle.
Well worth a viewing.
The producers must have got something right.
Not to be missed.
The ability to make jokes about that climate was equally important.
I do not think this is the point of the film at all.
I commend pictures that try something different.
A real window into a specific time and place in history.
Could almost believe this was a true story in a parallel universe.
Gotta start with Ed Furlong on this one.
God bless this kid.
Maybe that is why his performance was good.
The twists keep on coming.
Not glossed over a bit.
These guys are twins.
And some of them are smoking hot.
Merry mayhem is what would happen.
I have to say I totally loved the movie.
It shows how a young gay boy would be treated while growing up.
I had friends who were picked on for one thing or another .
And if you need it explained to you .
This film has good characters with excellent performances from the cast.
The slick soundtrack betrays the murder ballad tone of the film.
I just finished watching this film and found it very enjoyable.
And David plays the bad guy to perfection.
There is much more to this film than first meets the eye.
His character held my attention.
The other people in the story were essential in the makeup of his character.
The way they banded together to help one another was truly awe inspiring.
This is one of the most interesting movies I have ever seen.
I love the backwoods feel of this movie.
The movie is very realistic and believable.
Henry Thomas works well with the young baby.
Very moving story and worth a look.
I saw this film last night on cable and it is extraordinary.
This film is wonderfully atmospheric.
I recommend it highly.
I think that Fox has done it again.
This movie is great to make fun of.
Rent it for a good laugh.
And that is when they meet Ernest Keller.
And he offers to let them stay at his home.
Just seeing this cast in these scenes makes it worth a look.
Barbara Bach and Doug Barr make nice eye candy.
This film is creepy yet cheesy at the same time.
I rated it an 8 out of 10.
His persistent friendliness and almost naturally perverted appearance are exactly what the character needed.
The final shot is especially sad.
Get this film if at all possible.
The gals ask around but there is just nowhere to go.
Bach finally gets home and wants to know where her friends are.
A real treat for your collection.
all the acting done in the first season has been really amazing.
the minis do the best acting job that i have ever seen kids do.
the main actors and actresses i.
Jessica Alba Michael Weatherly etc.
make you forget you are watching a fictional t.
show they seem to make this show come alive.
all in all this is the best show i have ever watched.
One is the art direction.
The other thing is the comic timing.
I thought I should qualify my position after reading other reviews.
The lighting and scenes along with the camera work are great.
The music is pretty good and the gore is good.
There was no sex scenes.
I gave it 7 out of 10 and I think that is fair.
I would watch it again if I had nothing better to do.
The film just wanders along its merry way with very little development.
A decent effort and worth seeing IF you like serial killer flicks.
Campbell is to check this film out anyway and see what else Mr.
Campbell are trying to show you.
Check this one out.
I think this show is definitely the greatest show.
Jessica Alba does such a great job in it.
It was a revelation to us.
Obviously we were wrong.
But we both chose that love anyway.
That kind of stuff is for the Christian wackos.
As we aged we stopped having extramarital affairs.
This story is not far fetched.
My wife and I have been sleeping together for the last 40 years.
We are still gay.
It is a fantasy not unlike a cinder girl becoming a Princess.
Pretty boys being looked after by older not so pretty men.
Bathhouses were an integral part of the gay community.
This movie is as unique as it is overlooked.
The only other problem with that is that Stella herself is a lesbian.
What she finds will leave the viewer stunned.
What was lacking for me was a coherent storyline.
If you take it too seriously the audience will find little to enjoy.
The budget of around 10 million has not been well spent.
The opening action is okay but after that the good moments become more sparse.
There are some good moments.
As for the cast.
Hidden Agenda boasted the best cast Dolph has worked with in ages.
This however has problems.
The actors are on the most part bad.
This movie is all about Dolph though.
It also marks a turning point in his career.
This is an absolute great show.
She is definitely one of a kind and absolutely gorgeous.
This should be higher then 4.
There is a bit of blood and violence.
Jennifer Baxter is very cute and is good as The fiancée.
rest of the cast do fine.
I just viewed Detention last night and i liked what i saw.
It was a cool fun movie.
Dolph looked superbly cool on the Bike.
He also looked good in this movie as compared to his other recent movies.
He is now in a pretty good shape.
But it also had its share of Problems.
Another problem which i had was the way the students were swearing.
The third problem was that the bad guys were very few in numbers.
There should have been more bad guys.
Overall the movie was a good Movie.
I would recommend others to watch it.
Now u r a DEAD beat cop.
Rarely has something free been so worth invaluable.
He would deal with her later.
It was led by a German American taking his cue directly from the homeland.
These great films may be too simplistic for World War II history buffs.
It was truly a lot of fun.
The special effects were wonderful.
Blair Witch and The Mummy.
Both films that I thought were terrible.
Blair was probably the most overrated horror film of all time.
People liked it for it is special effects.
But that is about it.
A lot of computer generated special effects and nothing more.
Check this one out and form your own opinion on it.
I give this picture 7 out of 10.
Some films just simply should not be remade.
This is one of them.
In and of itself it is not a bad film.
But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more.
I do not know why the critics trashed this movie.
I hardly ever agree with them anyway.
Liam was great as always.
The special and sound effects were awesome.
I know it is fashionable now to hate this movie.
I have seen it 15 times now and it gets better every time.
The Haunting lets go and is certainly not boring.
The old Haunting was also a fine film from 1963.
It was even more scary.
What I wish could have happened is for something a little more intense.
The Haunting could have used a few more scenes of pure terror.
The acting is good and there are moments that make you jump.
I just wish it scared me more.
It seems to be a perfect day for swimming.
There is a double question the movie poses.
Some psychological battling there.
It just absolutely rattled me.
I was on vacation with my aunts in Ft.
The plot is about as simple as it gets.
The friction between them is a hoot.
Still a sturdy thriller which builds to an exciting and edifying conclusion.
He died in 1988.
It just makes me feel good.
The two are like apples and oranges.
I watched this movie after seeing it on Broadway.
I love the Broadway musical and I love the movie.
I watched the movie like it was not related to the Broadway show.
I danced for 12 years before I had to make a choice.
I was however super talented as a show rider.
and dedicate to one or the other.
I love the movie.
I love the Broadway musical.
Douglas is also probably not the best choice for the part.
but best of all.
i suggest you do to.
I love this movie.
This is a great movie.
That is an incorrect view.
And that I think is really the point of the whole show.
This is a study of life as a Broadway star.
This is a great musical.
The estate looked like an old prison.
His portrayal of Johnny and the fanatical following he inspired was very frightening.
Ann Heywood was also very good as the cynical Cathie.
Thank heavens for Turner Classic which aired the show last week.
Some of the boys are a bit scary.
Time has helped heal those wounds.
Understandably because of this the film is seldom aired or available to modern audiences.
Also has the best signature tune of any comedy show.
The comedy rests on the mix of the people sharing.
A man and two women.
Ironically the party was held to say goodbye to their old flatmate.
The obvious ends up happening as he moves in.
What a pity modern comedy can not reach that high standard.
This was in fact untrue.
They are so impressed by his culinary skills that they invite him to stay.
But there must be no naughty business.
So Robin has to pretend to be gay.
She was not alone.
He worked so well he was made into a regular.
Most of its characters had never appeared in the series.
His attention to use of light within scenes is remarkable.
The ending is wonderful.
I must confess that I was completely shocked by this film.
If you think you are into this kind of thing then go.
Overall the film is about real people in an unusual situation.
The second season though suddenly became a bit odd compared to the first.
So I really wish they could start making new episodes.
And with James Cameron behind this it can not go wrong.
I caught this on the dish last night.
I liked the movie.
I liked the look Ben Chaplin has through the whole movie.
Rent it or catch it on the dish like I did.
Maybe they are too implausible.
Birthday Girl is a movie I have enjoyed several times.
Rest of the cast are fine.
I know what I'm talking about.
You will love it.
I spent a ton of time putting it together.
So check it out.
You can not just order her to arrive at your airport.
US Immigration would NEVER allow such a thing to happen.
This is not Great Cinema but I was most entertained.
Given most films these days this is High Praise indeed.
Every time I see Nicole I like her more.
I love a movie like this.
Funny how people miss the point.
I forgot what a gorgeous woman she is.
Some unexpected turns in the story are good for the suspense.
A small funny film.
One think is sure too.
Here she is a natural woman and she does a really great job.
Instead it accurately records necessary growth arising from the films unique circumstances.
Maybe it is just makeup but it was amazing.
Despite my gratuitous digs at Ms.
Nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is.
The society is suffering from corruption.
The atmosphere is astounding.
It proved to be quite worthy of watching.
She just keeps proving that she is one of the top talents in Hollywood.
This film is definitely an odd love story.
until two hours of write this.
The woman that he finds comes from Russia.
And I'm not sorry in say that this is a masterpiece.
Three out of four stars.
The acting is first class and the characters are represented well.
My vote is eight.
This is not a big budget film.
Rather it is a film that has a strong community feel.
it is to behold .
But it is a less glamorous and more in you face tale.
The Scots excel at storytelling.
She makes the characters come alive.
The same story is told in bars the length and breadth of Scotland.
The discussion continued to closing time.
Stories passed down like this become part of our being.
And also introduces the story that stretches back through generations.
It produces stories within stories.
The stuff of legend.
This is what gives it its special charm.
He burns with frustration.
Yet there is a deeper conflict within him.
He yearns to know the truth.
She has done numerous guest spots and commercials up here in Canada.
Finally someone has the sense to create a show for her.
The supporting case seems quite good too.
I have now watched the pilot several times and I still find it refreshing.
It is a fresh idea and hopefully it does well.
One thing I just thought of though.
Shame on Global for pulling the plug on this one.
I thought this one would be a winner.
It is a great story and also inspires others.
It is unfortunate that the Challenger Accident delayed and hurt the movie.
The 20th Anniversary of the Challenger Accident is coming up.
Julia has been growing up fast.
Wow are we ever going to miss his movies if society collapses.
definitely needed a little work in season 2.
Very good drama in season two.
I was seriously hoping for a third and final season.
I would recommend this as a nice night in movie and a 7 Vote.
Just a cute movie with some subtle comedy to lighten things up.
I personally really like movies like this from time to time.
Nothing too deep or too scary.
Just a nice story line.
And I would have never known Mr.
Phoenix had I not recently read the credits.
He was just a baby really when he made this movie.
Kelly Preston was quite the young budding actress then too.
She and Lea did a wonderful job in this movie.
I agree it is not an Oscar caliber movie.
But very much worth watching.
Or ones that are interested in the space program.
Space Camp is a pretty decent film.
The scene where the shuttle doors open in space is simply spectacular.
it just looks average.
I remember this scene in the theater.
It made you feel like you were really up there.
I was quite impressed.
This film is none of those.
SO sit back with your kids and prepare to enjoy.
The perfect space fantasy film.
This would not be a family film if they all died.
Then it will all be sad.
That sucks so bad.
This film is the best for sure.
And the oxygen in ship was running short.
The view was great from outer space.
It does not look unreal.
i would like to comment the series as a great effort.
I'm glad they did.
Which really enhanced the viewing a lot.
I had never heard of the others in the movie.
I finally found it available in a certain store and bought it.
I will probably have it forever.
This movie gets a 9 out of 10 from me.
Watching this movie again really brought back some great childhood memories .
It was just like revisiting my childhood.
It was an absolutely amazing experience for me.
I will always cherish this movie for that reason.
Those outlets can only show you what happened on the outside.
This film shows you what happened on the INSIDE.
It is a sight you will not soon forget.
We must never forget.
Now I have seen the movie.
Thank God I did.
It offered me closure.
I can now move on with my life.
As the second plane crashes the people understand that this is not an accident.
No other documentary even comes close.
I can not see how this could have been done any different.
I have read most of the comments here.
But I do not think narration is unnecessary.
Like I lot of theorists I think that our own lives are narrations.
We are living and making our own autobiography.
We create a story about our live.
Because in the form of a story we can identify ourselves.
So that is the purpose of adding a story in documentary.
If it was me out there I would be worried sick about my brother.
In my view it would have been better to leave this out.
Nevertheless it is compelling viewing for the depiction of the events.
Conspiracy theorists can go to hell by the way.
Jules asked the captain to follow him into the Towers.
It took me a year to come to grips with the devastation.
I was sick of hearing about it.
It was the first time I had cried since the attack.
I highly recommend this documentary.
These two brothers make me want to have been there to help.
This movie had nobody known.
To sum this documentary up in a few words is next to impossible.
The story was thought up by two French brothers living in New York.
Then the unthinkable occurs.
His work is professional through his baptism of fire.
It ranks up there with the Hindenburg footage in showing history as it unfolds.
I also commend CBS for their bravery at airing this special.
Heroism at its finest and the cost of freedom.
I can not just choose one scene that stood out for me.
There was truly a disturbance in the Force.
This documentary vividly reveals this disturbance.
The feelings are so incredibly visual.
Not a thing is missed.
This is a powerful and most moving documentary and well deserving of the Emmy.
You will need them.
I know that I did.
This is an amazing documentary about a shocking day.
I beg you to consider the fact that the documentary was made.
The courage that it took to shoot this film is most notable.
We find that the two brothers are split up when that moment happened.
I submit a wholehearted 10.
Action will never reach this level.
It spoke of things inescapable to the eye of the camera.
It is art without question or questions.
Tears came to my eyes watching this documentary.
All my memories returned and just the intense images were unbelievable.
How these guys were able to capture this footage was incredible.
That reason alone is why this should be a must see collectors item.
The brothers appear to realistically portray the process of becoming a NYC firefighter.
Life and death hang in the balance.
They were probably added just to attract more television viewers.
Nonpareil portrayals of raw human emotion and drama.
5 out of 10.
The effect would be greater.
I'm reading the books now.
Anyone not moved by this television show is immune to anything.
My roommate had bought this documentary and invited me to watch it with her.
But I do not think we thought about what they were really going though.
They heard the bodies collapsing on the ground from people jumping out the windows.
May God bless their kind and brave hearts.
She got to see the truth of what had happened that tragic day.
No one expected this to happen.
How wrong I was.
You can not duplicate this.
A great piece of work.
A thin story with many fine shots.
You can see his humor in all his movies.
I love Monte Carlo and thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
I thought everyone was very good.
George Hamilton was charming and the perfect Italian gigolo.
James Belushi is hysterical as a total jerk.
Cybill Shepard gave a very sweet performance as a nice vulnerable ignored housewife.
Just a nice pick me up for a dreary day.
I Spent 5 Years searching for it.
Because his characters are loved and ask to be loved.
But he succeeds in making a good product.
It has an interesting plot complete with lovable characters.
The three main actors.
The show was hilarious to say the least.
Simple and complex jokes that could appeal to all ages.
Running jokes throughout the series that could spawn a drinking game.
I enjoyed this movie.
It is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric.
I saw that when I was little and it was excellent.
I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one that loved this movie.
we would watch it all the time.
Big rock candy mountain is amazing.
it is so fuzzy and colorful that i dream about it at night.
i recommend that people of all ages watch this movie.
we are going to order pizza and watch the teddy bears giggle.
This show teaches good lessons about imagination and getting along well with others.
Some parts I found quite entertaining.
I would recommend this.
Chuck Norris have many plans for the future .
Good marshal arts acting.
Perhaps the writer should actually WATCH the movie before attempting to comment on it.
I have always enjoyed seeing Chuck Norris in film.
I also enjoyed seeing Judson Mills perform along side him.
The movie was very similar to the events of Sept.
It has a lot of adventure in it.
You will not be disappointed with either one.
A time when it was in to be a swinger.
Not much more to it.
Anna is always eating but must have incredible metabolism.
50 CAN a month you can spend.
Lars Von Triers Europa is an extremely good film.
The final scene is one of the most harrowing scenes ever.
This movie is far better than the original The Jerk.
I would highly recommend it to anyone who like quirky humor.
The card game with the hobos and then with Mr.
The scene at the dinner table and his distaste for turtle soup.
The original The Jerk was too choreographed ans staged.
The Jerk Too is a spoof and will be enjoyed by anyone.
The Jerk Too is family friendly unlike the original The Jerk.
taking nothing away from Marty.
I wish I could get a copy of it for my collection.
I urge you to see it if you can find it.
I'm on the opposite end of the previous comment.
I say give this movie some credit.
It does have plenty of laughs in it.
I do not understand.
My confusion lies with the content.
303 Brownings in a dorsal turret.
Really loved the cinematography and direction.
Pace was just right and the portrayals of nearly all characters was impressive.
and I have yet to see Gladiator.
Everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected.
I replay their scenes over and over again.
Anyone who has ever been in love will empathize with these people.
All characters are cast and portrayed excellently.
I have watched this movie numerous times and it always makes me laugh.
Very nicely done movie.
It does stay in your memory.
He is good and exudes charm.
I'm glad it allowed as I have heard the sequels are equally outrageous.
Everyone involved in this film clearly had a lot of fun making it.
For entertainment value I found this movie to be both engaging and repugnant.
They depict the seats of government as being like a revivalist Baptist church.
It is really well done and very entertaining.
It clearly marks a moment in time for our collective consciousness.
the guts and entrails were actually very convincing.
very good for a laugh.
But It was a great mystery that can happen to anyone of us.
i found this movie really great and scary.
and the mind is a powerful thing.
i recommend to watch this movie.
for those who rate it a 1.
they do not understand the film.
and how bad the ocean life can be for each and everyone of us.
One of the great classic comedies.
This is THE spoiler.
We do not see that she is alone.
The girl is saved by a crew in a helicopter and another boat.
But I closed my eyes.
The other role that sticks in my mind is that of William Conrad.
I would never see or heard of him before this film.
Conrad plays a terrific part in this film.
It seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth.
Only Phyllis Kirk has any feeling for him.
They humiliate Sinatra and run him out of town.
Pity for some reason this has not been seen for years.
Bill is an excellent actor and would love to see him in more films.
It was a wonderful ensemble performance from all concerned.
i have seen it 3 times so far.
I watched the movie in a preview and I really loved it.
The cast is excellent and the plot is sometimes absolutely hilarious.
Post WWII life is simply and idyllically portrayed.
Art Direction and Editing are way above par.
I enjoyed Still Crazy more than any film I have seen in years.
The concert at the end was unreal.
You have to watch it.
Once again great movie.
I suppose it is fitting that this was his last film.
4 out of 10.
I love this movie.
I would like to see more movies like this.
And when you get to the final scene.
I thought this movie was fantastic.
Kinda reminded me of Spinal Tap.
You will not regret seeing this movie.
I know I do not.
Bruce Robinson was awesome.
Helena was a lovely girlfriend.
The point is this movie deserves repeated viewings.
He has an appealing hangdog look that makes women want to hug him.
But all the actors are equally brilliant.
Ignore any pans you read about this movie and see it.
Another example of the unique talents of Cary Grant.
So I rented it.
And that is not bad at all.
He sets off in search of the other members of the band.
Somewhat reluctantly the band agree to give the reunion a try.
But he wants them to start touring again first.
And so they hit the club circuit around Europe.
It is on tour that the film really starts to develop.
And they rediscover some of the interpersonal chemistry that made playing together so enjoyable.
Guess I will have to rent that next.
She loves the song so much now.
A triple whammy there.
The soundtrack is excellent.
All Grant can do is moan.
A classic movie that is really a treasure.
Far much better than Spinal Tap for instance.
They want to catch up with their crazy youth they miss so much.
Like anyone of us.
It was just another movie I watched partly on TV.
Then on several film posters and the film script.
A story about men getting along with each other.
It contains some of the best actors possible.
I'm addicted to this film.
I'm addicted to Strange Fruit.
This movie is tremendous for uplifting the Spirits.
The soundtrack is unbelievable.
Each member of Fruit are quite memorable.
The lifestyle depicted was remarkable in itself.
This was the first time I saw real people using cordless phones.
at the time anyway.
BTW I am a married man.
One of the Hong Kong Films of the year.
Strongly recommended to all Asian films lovers.
The ending is surprising but thoroughly consistent and believable.
Election does have some faults with the majority coming in the opening third.
Where Election really soars is its attention to that fine detail.
Simon Yam was my favorite character here and sort of anchors the picture.
Both films are gangster epics that are similar in form.
And while Election is an enjoyable piece of cinema.
it is just not nearly as good as it is sequel.
This has disastrous results and heads the triads into an all out war.
Much of the film is devoted to the recovery of the Baton.
Fans of the gangster genre are likely to appreciate it in that aspect.
This is dark and grim.
The pacing is relatively slow and deliberate.
People just randomly do things regardless of how their personalities were set up prior.
The performances are reasonably amusing and colorful.
Big D will change his tune or.
Another good watch would be Dragon Squad.
Election marks the 2nd trial society theme movie directed by Johnnie To.
Election has hardly failed any critics who wants an different trial society theme movie.
This film really deserves more recognition than its getting.
And a scream or two.
I was really excited about seeing this film.
I thought finally Australia had made a good film.
but I was wrong.
This was the most pathetic attempt at a slasher film ever.
I was expecting a big surprise about who the killer was.
which turned this realistic slasher film into an awful horror movie.
It was the first time I have seen a theatrically release Australian slasher flick.
I thought that the movie was pretty good.
mostly everything in UL final cut needed to be improved.
The best part of CUT is the killer and the death scenes.
i give cut a 8 out of 10.
There is so much to love in this darling little comedy.
It falls somewhere in the middle.
None of these comments are relevant.
Probably a bit of both.
This is not a bad movie.
So this might be an example of what the genre has become.
I liked it I gave it an eight.
The Direction is good.
Jessica Napier is cute and does fine as the other heroine.
Rest of the cast are fine.
however there are some good positives in this film.
there are a few concerns about this movie.
i enjoyed it and had some fun.
Suspenseful Australian slasher flick with very few scares.
Really bad slasher flicks.
But that is par for the course.
The director tells off the killer in front of the cast and crew.
He goes crazy and kills two people.
People who try and finish it are killed themselves.
The students ignore that.
No one is great but no one is terrible either.
No great shakes but not bad at all.
I give it a 7.
This is one of those little Christmas movies for everyone.
There really IS something for everyone.
You will have to see the movie if you want to know why.
00 from the total.
This movie is better than 4.
I can see this happening.
wealthy people have done crazier things than this.
And it was funny.
This movie fully suits that purpose.
You can survive Surviving Christmas.
I thought the television version was a bit edited way down.
This movie is definitely a fresh new idea that was pulled off pretty well.
It was a fun and funny movie.
It was a wonderful movie that I will be adding to my Christmas selection.
I rate it right up there with Christmas vacation.
This movie turned out to be one laugh after another.
He then drives the family crazy with overindulgence for Christmas cheer.
Sure you can see where this movie is going but you do not care.
I got what I wanted.
I laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt.
Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd are delightful in this film.
I can not imagine anyone not enjoying this movie completely.
a true feast for the eyes.
It was number 10 on The 100 Greatest TV Treats 2004.
This is probably the best documentary I have seen in a very long time.
Listening to his smart ass remarks and seeing his adorable gestures was heartwarming.
And seeing him smile was indescribable.
I feel blessed to have been able to be touched by this tiny giant.
i was greatly moved when i watched the movie.
i have seen people in tears because of a blemish.
this movie brings everything back to the basics .
it makes our everyday problems seen for what they are Small and really unimportant.
you are truly blessed.
and the saying stop and smell the roses truly has a new meaning.
This man is nothing short of amazing.
The most moving and truly eye opening documentary ever created.
I truly felt for him.
I believe that this should be compulsory viewing in schools.
He was on a crusade to raise money for his cause.
I highly recommend this.
You watch as John lives through the last couple months of his life.
You watch as he goes through his days with a positive attitude.
At one point you begin to see that he is truly an amazing individual.
You begin to understand that he has something to teach all of us.
He became a poet in exile wondering how to change the world.
The wind blows your eyes far away.
But the film still ends on an optimistic note.
The problem was there literally were not enough houses to satisfy the demand.
Bradford in order to solve this very strange murder mystery.
Jean Arthur is quite glamorous in her role and very funny.
Jean Arthur SHINES when she looks at Powell.
There is an unmistakable undercurrent buzzing between them.
My friends thought the same.
They succeeded to some degree.
So by this time he was pretty well set in the role.
This is after he comes to Bill Powell for help.
Myrna Loy was a more steadying influence on Bill Powell than Jean Arthur was.
Arthur plays it as more of a dizzy dame than Loy did.
But it works here and she and Powell have good chemistry.
Good but not great.
In a way I feel it could have been that bit better.
The Five Deadly Venoms is easily the most memorable K.
This movie launched the careers of the five men who play the venoms.
He would go on to be in Super Ninjas.
I loved this film.
The comedy is well played by all involved.
Talent ran in that family.
I recall seeing this movie as a kid.
I do not recall where I saw it.
I must have been around 14 years old.
I thought the movie was incredible and wished to see it again.
I was really bummed.
The fights were very short and few and far between.
The fighting is all pretty routine.
I remember lots of them.
I remember the day clearly.
Me and my dad had just gotten lunch at Burger King.
Then under that was the Title of the film.
It said Five Deadly Venoms.
Then the movie began.
I loved this movie the minute it came on.
My favorite character was the Toad Venom.
it was the fighting.
The fights were so.
This movie is really good.
Fighting scenes are very good.
The only thing which may be irritating is actors look.
I really like this movie.
I can watch it on a regular basis and not tire of it.
I suppose that is one of my criteria for a great movie.
The story is very interesting.
We also get to see the venoms fight each other in every combination.
It is fun to see how their styles match up against each other.
See this one at all costs.
This film is breath of fresh air in comparison.
Around 7 out of 10.
Then again he might not have.
Lead players Cary Grant and Myrna Loy plays Mr.
Thus a simple plot becomes almost a suspense thriller.
But what really solidifies the movie are the venoms themselves.
Five men trained by the same master in different ways and wearing masks.
Its more about the intrigue of the story and the characters that are involved.
Very well made with a unique story.
Be careful with this one.
We learn along with him.
I can not say enough about the choreography or the camera work.
But this one does several things well.
Much more clever stuff than what we usually get out of this genre.
Still though this movie is one of Shaw Brothers best and is quite enjoyable.
8 out of 10 on the scale.
Such level of skill amongst the cast is unsurpassed in modern day cinema.
However the plot certainly is better than average.
I always enjoy this movie when it shows up on TV.
This makes some of the scenes in the movie much more effective.
We actually care when people are killed in this film.
Some of the sequences in this movie are truly gut wrenching.
When characters go in search of vengeance you really feel their anger and pain.
all this just adds to the greatness of the film.
The lighting and composition are spectacular at times.
He is an important filmmaker who continues to influence many people.
The thought of Sarah Silverman having her own show worried me at first.
The one downfall of this show is its supporting cast.
A VERY good chance from the usual comedy out there.
The Sarah Silverman program is .
better than those other shows.
The Sarah Silverman program.
Go watch and see.
Best show since Seinfeld.
One of the few shows I make point of watching.
It gets flat very fast.
Give it a shot.
It has that same flow and that same rhythm.
Melvin Douglas is especially brilliant.
The best kind of comedy around.
Nothing that appears on T.
show for there to be mistakes.
This show is stupid because Sarah wanted it to be stupid.
This show is juvenile because Sarah wanted it to be juvenile.
The cast is awesome.
I'm sure they are wonderful bright people that operate at a different wavelength.
Therefore I always fast before watching it and wear adult diapers.
I'm a happy guy.
This is like Grease meets South Park.
Sarah Silverman is someone I could watch reading the phone book.
Her delivery is precise and oh so funny.
She never skips a beat.
It seemed to be a genuine question.
Sarah can come at you from odd angles.
God being petty and jealous added wonderfully to the joke.
What I also love is that not everything is a punchline.
Instead the Sarah Silverman Program makes it more realistic in this sense.
This show probably will not appeal to everyone.
Everyone should at least give this show a chance.
This kind of stuff is the future of entertainment.
I watch this show and I laugh a very large percentage of the time.
I can not say that about many TV shows.
You owe it to yourself to watch this show.
I predict a long run for this series.
perhaps they lack the intelligence to comprehend it.
they should stop making fools of themselves by attacking something they do not understand.
is way off the mark.
If you are thinking of building see this movie first.
The dollar amounts may have changed but everything else is the same.
This film was done after that rescue.
One of the best love stories I have ever seen.
Then I got to looking at their body of work.
Grey Gardens sounded very interesting.
She seems to have a nervous disorder of some kind.
Worrying too much about things.
It is a 28 room mansion that is worn down and worn out.
The outfits Edie comes up with a very clever and creative.
Edie too was a beauty in her day and quite attractive at 56.
This movie is hard to come by.
This as well makes it clear that it is not exploitation.
And both Edith and Edie just love the idea of being filmed.
Exhibit all their artistic skills in front of their camera.
Little Edie and Big Edie are characters that anyone can feel compassion for.
Grey Gardens is a world unto itself.
I was awed at how beautiful and raw this documentary was.
It is a sincere look into the unedited reality of a life of solitude.
really no words can describe.
The move Grey Gardens is beyond bizarre.
Both of them remain beautiful despite their encroaching age.
I first saw this film in 1980 in the midday movie spot.
It becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are well past eccentric.
The content is pretty much made up of two things.
The second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties.
Their hopes and dreams as decayed as the mansion they live in.
Despite their bickering these two need each other more than ever.
For without the other there would be no refuge from the loneliness.
Her response to a complaint about the smell is simply unbelievable.
bickered and performed while reminiscing of their past.
This is a film you will not soon forget.
I fell in love with this film and with the characters in it.
It has an air of sadness that permeates throughout.
A fall from greatness for this once esteemed family.
Excellent film showing the pathetic lives of two nutty old ladies.
I got to get to a hotel room.
he just gave us a washing machine.
raccoons and cats become a little bit boring for too long a time.
yes the pleasure is all mine.
bring me my little radio I have got to have some professional music.
It is she who will have the last laugh maybe.
Well worth your time.
This movie has more to recommend it than I can put down into words.
It is a rare experience that you must see for yourself.
And of course there are numerous cats running around.
As for the house itself.
It stars two spellbinding characters in what is unfortunately a mediocre documentary.
What a strange film.
have chosen to document.
Little Edie is even more interesting.
One of the better documentaries ever made and still a cult classic today.
The once beautiful gardens are now a jungle.
Clothing is seems to be optional.
There is a constant undercurrent of sexual tension.
Ice cream spread on crackers.
Edie feels like Edith thwarted any of her attempts at happiness.
Sometimes it is difficult to hear exactly what is being said.
Both women talk at the same time and constantly contradict each other.
This is a difficult film to watch but well worth the effort.
Renting Cypher was like a punt on a possibly very lame horse.
It must have been very quiet or I just missed it.
In any case the affects are secondary.
I will not give anything away about the plot.
Just give it a chance.
The character development is intentionally shallow.
Just a genius perfect combination for such a movie.
The viewer has to WATCH him and Think as this story unfolds.
Just go somewhere and secretly record and transmit inside data.
Take it from there.
Then it begins to accelerate.
I do not recommend that to anyone.
I'm not gonna say what cause that will spoil the hole movie.
I wish would it would never end.
Anyone could have played it.
Kaufman and Moss Hart.
The former was about moving into an 18th Century country house that.
The escalating costs of the project are one matter that bedevils Jim.
To categorize this film into a single genre would be criminal.
This is pure psychology.
Cypher is such a film.
They send him to different parts of America to record different seminars.
Covering topics as mundane as shaving cream and cheese.
And I'm not saying anything more about the plot.
And Cypher follows similar patterns.
But it is not a carbon copy of Cube.
It has it is own inspiration.
One thing that distinguishes Cypher from Cube is how much more polished it is.
The acting is uniformly excellent throughout.
His performance is excellent because it is so modulated.
He literally seems to transform right before our very eyes.
David Hewlett puts in a welcome appearance who made such an impact in Cube.
But Morgan deserves his happy ending.
Cypher succeeds on all counts.
And it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable Matrix.
And now I'm a committed fan of the man.
Cypher is an absolute masterpiece.
I can not overemphasis how phenomenal this movie is.
Cypher is one of the best spy movies ever conceived and ever made.
There is nothing wrong with or cheap about Cypher whatsoever.
This is not a spoiler.
Cypher is counterespionage at it is absolute best.
Hands down and hats off.
Nothing is what it seems and truth is stranger than fiction.
The future is now.
My vote is eight.
The conferences are all covers to allow the company men to brainwash their spies.
The cast are great.
The rest of the cast are also good.
He paces the film superbly as well and has given it a great look.
The efforts of the director and the actors combined in an effective thriller.
Grant has always been a favorite of mine in this type of role.
He is so good at playing the put upon husband.
Loy is a always a joy to watch.
The Thin Man films she made with William Powell are near perfect.
And that is where the comedy comes in.
But to say Cypher is a clone would be to its discredit.
This is not helped by a strange woman who turns up.
I guess given the time of production it was a mix of all three.
Admittedly the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable.
We were able to witness what appeared to be realistic training regimens and equipment.
Where this movie came together for me was closer to the end.
Stallone is Gabe Walker.
Cat and Mouse on the mountains with ruthless terrorists.
Stallone needed this role to get back on track.
The is placed in beautiful place and it is very exciting movie.
Another weak point was the unrealistic shooting scenes.
This movie had a lot of all time great potential.
Sill a good movie though.
I know I did.
The only caveat is that social attitudes have changed a lot since 1948.
Eight months has passed.
This was one of the biggest hits of 1993.
Stallone certainly made an short comeback of this sharp thriller.
Do not miss this great action film.
Based on a premise by John Long.
This movie is just great.
In my opinion this movie is highly underrated by the critics.
For the sake of the film though I willing to suspend my disbelief.
The deaths are inventive while others are sort of predictable.
This is the rhythm of the film in a nutshell.
You would better be.
The old guy who flies the chopper.
I have no idea what drugs he was on when he did it.
Since I first saw this in the theater it has been my favorite.
There has not been a movie I can compare this too.
This is an action movie at it is BEST.
I do not think I will see another that is so entertaining.
And it is particularly good in this movie.
The special effect are great and spectacular.
Stallone really needed that movie get back with success.
This movie was filmed in a magnificent natural environment.
I give it a 6.
My vote is eight.
As a Stallone fan this is one I look back on with fond memories.
Plenty of superb action and Sly in prime action man form.
have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the U.
government somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and they really would like it back.
A showcase of great scenes and stunts.
Quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever.
So that is two points for him before the film even starts.
the desire and need to bring fantasies to reality.
The diary contains magic formulas that supposedly enable prisoners to escape.
9 out of 10.
This is a movie that works best if you are immersed into it.
I was hooked from beginning to end.
The horror you create in your own mind.
but not in the way they imagined.
Now this is what I would call a good horror.
This is a timeless movie for all ages that is sure to please.
Achieving true comedic dialog is an art.
Watched this French horror film last night and pretty much liked it.
I'm glad I had a chance to watch this film.
The gore is a product of what the book unleashes.
My vote is seven.
The kills are raw and eerie.
I just wish the story had led to a more consistent finale.
We are inside a ramshackle French prison cell with four occupants.
It is an unholy alloy of triumphs and failures.
The characters are intriguing.
It has a real life ring to it.
That really is the problem with an obsession with understanding and knowledge.
Lensed well in 1.
The characters are superbly developed and the cast makes the most of them.
I think that was the Golden Age of English series.
They all shared equal screen time and all had their moments to shine.
the bluest eyes you would probably see on TV.
I have also followed Bill Gaunts career with interest since.
We absolutely adored it.
Hopefully it will find a new generation of fans.
Who I thought was beautiful and intelligent.
I was 10 years old when this show was on TV.
By far it was my favorite.
The actors were very credible.
There was a good story in each episode.
I highly recommend this TV show to anybody that like good stuff.
the thought that maybe they will not get together.
the dancing on the side of the road scene was magnificent.
except for maybe the fact that she is psycho.
Manhattan apartment dwellers have to put up with all kinds of inconveniences.
This is only the beginning of his problems.
The film is fun because of the three principals in it.
The direction of H.
This movie is wonderful.
Very witty and clever script.
The scenes are alive with fresh energy and really talented production.
It was nice to see Ally again.
She is one of my all time favorite movie actors.
I laughed and cried as the story unfolded.
Great story and cast.
Alice Drummond is Wise And Wonderful as Stella.
The roadside dance scene is brilliant.
Really liked this one.
This movie only confirms what was clear from that movie.
This comedy with much underlying pain and sadness succeeds where most others fail.
So was the case with most of the reviewers.
THOSE WHO THINK AND WRITE.
THOSE WRITE AND MAKE THE READERS THINK.
We share an addiction.
We are approval junkies.
I was very surprised to see the overall rating as 5.
This film is special.
I'm giving ten out of ten it is one of the best movies ever.
it is all very simple.
I have never known of a film to arouse such debate in my life.
I absolutely loved this film and i can not wait to see it again.
I saw the gala the other night and this movie definitely split the audience.
However there were many good things too.
well you have to see it.
I watched to movie today and it just blew my mind away.
Another thing I really liked about this film is how damn beautiful it is.
If you see it you will know what I mean.
watch it with an open mind and you may enjoy it.
And that is my 2 cents.
They do not expect him to explore new frontiers.
So this movie toys with your head.
This movie is different than Snatch.
but that is the shoddiest reason to disregard a piece of art.
Funny people can be thoughtful too.
I am still searching for some copy of the gorgeous soundtrack.
The excellent soundtrack compliments the film well.
I have been looking for this movie for so many years.
I saw this move when I was nine and loved this movie.
I called Disney all the movie stores and the net.
What a waste it was a very good movie.
The beginning was great and I remember becoming very attached to the little foxes.
This movie made me cry for hours.
It was a good movie.
She unknowingly walks into a foot trap.
He alone has to teach them the skills they need for life.
I felt emotionally gutted after seeing all this evil going on.
I was moved to tears.
Or they fall victims to tragedy themselves.
Best all around soundtrack and musical score I have ever heard.
And then there is the aftermath of what happened.
Guess you can make up your own mind about the true ending.
I'm left feeling that only one character should have survived at the end.
This film made John Glover a star.
And I mean that sport.
Maybe it is me.
A very strong and satisfying little number that is well worth checking out.
Three blackmailers leech onto him.
It also felt like a movie that took some cuts.
The actors involved give some of their finest performances.
Anyone who likes action combined with a gritty complicated story will enjoy this.
This slick and gritty film consistently delivers.
To call this film sleazy would be a huge understatement.
I do not know why I love this movie so much.
Just thinking about his voice is enough to make me chuckle.
Plenty of cameos by real life porno stars.
9 of 10 stars.
he died by getting shot in the eye.
This was the best and well orchestrated scene ever in the Sopranos.
But his legacy will live on forever.
Chase has created a true phenomenon with The Sopranos.
There is real skill here.
I simply love the beauty of the picture.
This is my favorite show.
I think it is utterly brilliant.
Thanks to David Chase for bringing this into my life.
the cast was excellent.
Long live the Sopranos and Tony Soprano.
Let me tell u something.
I started watching many T.
Then we have The Sopranos.
The raw emotion he displays is superb.
The story is nothing short of excellent.
Each episode is directed superbly and the Score of this show is just fantastic.
V show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that is The Sopranos.
But everyone is excellent.
And that is just the tip of the iceberg.
on a show and you are already winning points on in my book.
Every character represents a facet of American industry.
I'm sure that people from France would not appreciate the caricatures of the French.
My sides and my jaws were hurting at the end of the movie.
Not everything is perfect however.
It shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems.
A sort of chameleon quality to transcend roles.
She is wise if not wiser and more street savvy then Tony himself.
This in my opinion is the worst thing about the HBO series.
Too much space in between seasons and very sporadic.
This episode deals with my most favorite character of all time in The Sopranos.
He was killed for hijacking the wrong truck and accidentally killing a truck driver.
He was killed on a boat by Tony.
All the awesome characters are dead.
All the cool guys always get killed.
Each season is completely brilliant in its own way.
And it is not just him.
The first two seasons were extraordinary.
Trust me in that it will be well worth the time.
Each character unfolds more and more each series.
Every little detail builds the perfect TV series.
It is the single most genius text in cinematic history.
It can only be taken in portions.
its sort of exploitive.
by now I'm just trying to take up the ten line minimum.
My comment ended a while ago.
Hopefully it works when I submit it now.
The best TV ever.
A tip of the pork pie to Mr.
These guys were definitely the best of their generations and even more.
We have been totally spoiled now.
The argument of both are splendid and the actors are perfect.
Congratulations for such a work.
Sorry about my English.
It has so much more.
Many of the issues we see on the show are very real.
Watching this show you will find yourself realizing that these characters are NOT real.
This show is also very versatile.
Overall this is a masterpiece of a show.
This is what television should be.
The Sopranos is arguably the greatest show in Dramatic Television history.
The series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitous.
I want to make some comments about the movie itself.
First I would like to say how great this.
It is astounding and sometimes shocking.
It is like a trip through humanity.
Its stark realism shows through this monumental masterpiece.
From MIDNIGHT COWBOY we get a stark and sometimes disturbing urban view on life.
You do not have to steal it.
Nor is the script anywhere close to a Woody Allen or Mel Brooks.
The script is heavily but not obnoxiously aware that this is just a movie.
I think it was a brilliant decision by Hoffman to take this role.
Otherwise he may have been typecast after the Graduate.
Joe is shook up by a haunting childhood.
He has a strong fear and hatred of religion due to his traumatic baptism.
They go out and work together in helping each other out.
The two grow remarkably close and soon can not live without each other.
This is one of the greatest films ever made.
The difference is that this film is from their perspective.
and am not the least bit ashamed.
They smell no less sweet because they are of a different hue.
He gave them superbly.
Wayne got his Oscar.
if you can get in.
and are admired for it.
I get heartbroken for both.
Its both artistically valid yet entirely accessible and commercial.
No wonder it was a huge success when initially released.
The direction by John Schlesinger makes the material work.
It combines a simplistic style with some experimental editing.
Its still as powerful now as it was when initially released.
The acting however is what makes this a masterpiece.
The two eventually forge a bond that is both touching and pathetic.
He is so into character that all else around him pales in comparison.
Midnight Cowboy is not for everybody.
He does not apologize for his chosen profession but it is not that easy.
The film became famous and infamous almost overnight.
Very compelling and sensationally creative film that I highly recommend.
Saw this as a young naive punk when it was first released.
Thankfully this time I was at home.
This is one hell of a great movie.
His subconscious mirrors the way in which his real life is panning out.
They begin sharing everything in life.
It does not work out as he planned.
They live in an empty and very filthy apartment.
The editing in this movie is great.
Especially Hoffman delivers some fine famous lines.
The score is done by John Barry and sounds great.
At the time I recall being quite startled and amused by this movie.
Bernhard has an unusually perceptive behavioral notebook.
Nina Simone comes to mind.
The movie is quite long at two hours but never really seems very long.
I was pleasantly surprised.
What makes the film interesting is the two characters are so different.
I personally think the film beautifully and poignantly explores its main themes.
The religious connotations in the film are also puzzling.
Midnight cowboy should be required viewing at all film schools.
I recommend this film to everyone.
I'm giving it a 10.
But this one I can live with.
There are usually some pretty funny comics selected through.
when other comics clearly should have beaten them out.
This is where imagination wins out over fact.
Cordell is a recent widow and it is unclear how his wife died.
Her face is bloodied and her eyes are closed.
There are a few scenes that hint of incestuous possibilities.
He never really looks like he can be trusted in this film.
The Incubus is a well done film.
And bitter pills are always more difficult to swallow than sweet ones.
It also carries a kind of Gothic vibe as well.
Nice filming locations and some stylish camera work also highlight.
This is a wonderful film.
Perhaps a revival is just down the pipeline.
This is truly the greatest Swedish movie of all time.
It all creates a very vivid picture of a life that is long gone.
Exploding cigars provide a running gag.
A minor but admirable little film.
The very first shot might be startling.
It certainly adds to the gritty flavor of the atmosphere.
And he has a soft spot for ornery orphan Cooper.
this is not Steven kings best work.
i thought that his best work was the shining.
as if that person can do a better job in making a horror flick.
i mean making the gage evil and how he kills Jud is genius.
making the most innocent most unsuspecting character into one of the killers is cool.
i still recommend people to watch the movie.
The movie does skip far ahead and does miss some important parts.
First of all the plot is truly original and one of a kind.
The acting is also great and i love the cast.
Probably the most accurate Stephen King adaption yet.
The story follows the Creed family moving into a beautiful Maine house.
Maybe he was buried alive.
Nothing more I can say without ruining the story.
The characters are real and the situations are normal.
Mary Lambert does a great job directing the proceedings.
The scene where Gage is killed will stick in your mind forever.
Non Horror fans will want to avoid this.
This really captures the heart of the book.
Fred Gwynne is WONDERFUL.
THE ATMOSPHERE OF THIS FILM IS CERTAINLY A NOVELTY AND ONE OF A KIND.
this one is way beyond compare in intelligence compared to that stuff.
The acting is actually first rate for a film like this.
And the results are horrifying.
Highly recommended for genre fans.
5 out of 10.
A classic now and truly a must see for any Horror fan.
You will not regret.
But that is just my opinion.
Baby Gage was amazing even on his creepy parts.
Something is for sure.
Bernhard is a little of these influential entertainers and more.
Since Louis is a veterinarian and has a young toddler for a son.
And that third act.
One of the better Stephen King adaptations I would say.
And that is where the real horror story begins.
I personally find this movie very good.
and what is better than the dead coming to life.
and something about animals returning from the grave is quite creepy too.
and most important to me .
it stuck true with the novel.
They are greeted with kindness by Jud Crandall.
That is the start of hell for the Creed family.
The music in this movie plays an extravagant part.
It is at the same time sad and mysterious.
It goes along with the movie wonderfully.
But there is a pet cemetery behind their house.
That burial ground is pure evil.
There is one character in this film that is truly freaky.
This is truly one of most favorite horror films of all time.
10 out of 10.
I kind of liked The Lonely Lady.
Give Pia a break.
She looks great and she has really nice eyes.
But its a trashy movie.
A lot of movies that are trashy are not all bad.
Pia gets naked a lot and seems miscast as a writer.
A couple of the scenes are funny.
I want to see someone do that speech in a drama class.
You could find worse on any movie of the week back in the eighties.
This is an excellent film that will not disappoint you.
Hitchcock displays his already developed understanding for visuals in this early silent film.
Nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols.
The film also gives insight into his later treatment of women.
upscale supper clubs like the Parisian Room.
The scene in the club throughout the movie is dryer than a bone.
It may not be meant to be funny across the board.
Perhaps it is a bit unsettling or even maudlin for some.
A beautiful painting about love and death.
This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
This is a much more impressive film than its present obscurity would suggest.
Surprisingly good early effort from Alfred Hitchcock.
The Ring really deserves more recognition than the inferior but better known The Lodger.
One sequence remains in my memory to this day.
and for a few seconds there it is.
has gone and it is time for the spacecraft to return to Earth.
This documentary was nominated for an Oscar and it is easy to see why.
Good use of live footage and animation in tandem.
I remember these shows when they were first broadcast on Disneyland.
That was fifty years ago.
Turn around and you are a young wife with babes of your own.
you are wondering how much has really changed in 50 years.
A recommended film which was the first for Jim Henson Productions.
She was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had lots of extracurricular money.
Trudy also raised two chimps in her home to be more like children.
They dressed in clothes and had many amenities.
Rene Russo plays her role wonderfully feminine.
And that is what happens.
A speed boat is no match to our busy beaver on the river.
We also know when he is going to be wounded.
It is the forbidden or the restricted that is attractive.
My heart goes out to them.
The story is extremely unique.
The ending COULD have been fantastic.
The animation is decent for 89 but can not compare to nowadays.
I have also heard many complain about the cheesiness of the nudity.
I actually found it to be somewhat decent.
Overall it deserves a look but the ending keeps it from being a classic.
There are no loops and sequences in which the art decreases in quality.
The last episode was entirely done in black and white.
The music is very typical space opera fair.
Neither aspect is ever left completely out though.
But it is done exceptionally well for a change.
It will grow on you.
There are a few surprises.
And the music is OUT OF THIS WORLD.
playing bar room characters in both.
He shows finely nuanced performances .
the good and the bad in his characters.
making love to an actress you kinda grew up with.
What a surprisingly good movie this one turned out to be.
This is the type of film that I have been looking for ages.
Star Trek Hidden Frontier will surprise you in many ways.
We can get by that.
Better than almost anything you have seen.
It takes a lot of effort to put on a production of this magnitude.
I highly recommend taking the time to down load and watch.
This is short and to the point.
I will not rehash what has already been said about the sets and graphics.
Congratulations to the cast and crew for an effort that many admire.
BUT BUT the idea of two guys kissing makes me wind forward the episode.
For a fan series this is good stuff.
The local sheriff is behind the crime and the nightmare begins.
Especially the second murder is pretty grim.
7 out of 10.
The ships are rendered well and the space battles are impressive and exciting.
Musically it is a mixed bag.
The episodes are character driven and the characters develop over many episodes.
Hidden Frontier takes taboos that even the official series has shrunk from using.
All in all I enjoyed watching it.
God Bless you all.
This film predates these shows though the effect seems the same.
You potential stars of tomorrow.
There was not quite enough action for me I must say.
The film portrayed the life of a traitor.
He has no real love or loyalty in him.
Heavy psychological stuff and not many light moments in the 6 hour series.
Very well done though.
It had a gritty authenticity and rang true in every way.
The rest of the supporting is excellent as well.
The production values of the miniseries are strong as well.
Yet the highlight of the miniseries is really the script.
This is my second time through for A Perfect Spy.
I watched it 2 or 3 years ago and liked it.
I like it still.
Throughout the story he betrays and is betrayed.
Another theme is that of malignancy.
I really enjoyed it in the end.
Peter Egan is fascinating to watch because his face changes with every camera angle.
But this is a minor and unimportant seam in the whole.
Jane Booker is annoying as Mary Pym.
The British view of Americans is vividly rendered in some dryly hilarious scenes.
The humor and sadness are subtly blended.
It is an accurate reflection of the period in which it is set.
Betrayal is the key by everybody for the good of nobody.
Pym upbringing is so close to my own that I find it chilling watching.
Because there is a good story around the naked rituals and sex scenes.
She exuded massive quantities of sexuality throughout the film.
One wishes they made more movies like this one.
Strongly recommended for fans of international cinema.
And there are some very interesting candles and uses for them.
This masterpiece of lesbian horror comes from exploitation master Joseph W.
but they may not be as helpless as they seem.
this was one of the funniest and informative shows that I have ever seen.
This is a MUST see for anyone over the age of 16.
this show had me and my 2 boys laughing out loud from the beginning.
I agree with the idea of making this a HBO series.
It would have an amazing following.
But after seeing it I realized what a funny man he is.
but some other parts of the world.
I enjoyed how Mr.
But it quickly sucked me in.
I would love to see this picked up as a series for HBO.
He covers fallacies of history and truths that are no longer generally known.
I would like to see much more of this show.
It is very entertaining.
It is well worth your time.
only we soon discover both men have hidden intentions.
My interest was raised as I was flipping through and saw the name Iphigenia.
I am so glad I stayed on the channel.
She is visually stunning.
This is a great film.
There is the uncomfortable racism which is depicted.
But it is everything you could want in a movie.
Now I have seen it.
The parts themselves are often very good and the action sequences are great.
She insists Tarzan to carry a bracelet who belonged to her father.
Well it is supposed to proof Tarzan is dead.
The caravan is leaving and Jane go along.
She could be smart.
If she get home to England without have done this she would become miserable.
Jane is smart but cheap drama brings her down.
Just lean back and enjoy.
John Dillinger escapes from prison and robs a bank in Iowa.
I got a huge kick out of this movie.
The chemistry between Johnny and Maureen is irresistible.
See it for yourself if you do not believe me.
I love Maureen O'Sullivan most of all in this film.
She totally has the ape man at her every beck and call.
Eventually Tarzan and Jane show up and everyone is off on even more adventures.
Its an amazing film by almost any standard.
Its an amazing thing.
I really like this film a great deal.
However on almost every other level this film is top notch.
You really owe it to yourself to see this.
This is one of the great adventures.
There is NO mistake about that at all.
I thought the script was really well thought out and written tightly.
One final word about nudity.
that is the way colored people were thought of and portrayed back then.
Safaris actually did use natives carrying luggage on their heads.
I'm not making this up.
She and Tarzan are shown waking up one morning in their treetop shelter.
Savage Tarzan is innocently sexy.
Another reason why the hung up regarded this film as sinful.
They want Tarzan to guide them to said graveyard.
It is Jane who maintains her cool.
So there you have it.
An utterly subversive film.
Tarzan and Jane are living happily in the jungle.
Some men come looking for ivory and to take Jane back to civilization.
But Jane loves Tarzan and refuses to leave.
even if that means killing Tarzan.
This one has MUCH better effects and is a lot more adult.
Everybody else is OK.
The first of the Tarzan movies staring Johnny Weissmuller.
The plot has already been summarized so i wont go into it again.
you are missing a Real treat.
no one will ever play Tarzan as well as Johnny Weissmuller did.
He was and is Tarzan.
He climbs a hill to tell Iphigenia that he will protect her.
It is a sharp and sad epiphany that lasts only for an instant.
Forrester Harvey and Nathan Curry round out a small cast very professionally.
The crisp display of later Tarzan films is lacking here.
Later she admits to Tarzan that she was wrong.
This to me is very much at the core of the Tarzan experience.
I would recommend this movie strongly to anyone.
The movie can never decide whether we should like him or hate him.
Tarzan kills lions and rhinos and a steadily increasing number of animals.
They still do not need to talk a lot.
They sleep together and hang out with cool animals and stay away from cities.
No wonder they are happy.
The skin show in this film is off the charts.
As noted by other reviewers this is one of the best Tarzan movies.
The only things missing are color and stereo sound.
Her outfit showed what a great figure Maureen O'Sullivan possessed.
There is plenty of action in here.
Maureen O'Sullivan is charming and beautiful as Jane and walks off with the movie.
But a savage tribe and hideous torture await the group.
com if you know where I can buy a copy.
We watched it last night for the first time.
I was also impressed at how true it was to the play.
The catalog is around here someplace.
This movie gets it right.
The tedium of the application process.
The waiting for word.
The joy of acceptance.
The worry about making it through the course.
The glory of graduation.
Many are called but few are chosen.
We did for pay what we would have eagerly paid to do.
I had a personal interest in this movie.
for one or two weeks.
The three central characters in this movie are really pretty ugly people.
This is the longest version of the story and goes deeply into characterization.
Its also a lot more sexual than the Lana Turner version.
We have a very obvious adulterous relationship and Giovanna is very obviously a nymphomaniac.
This is a far greater study of the working class than of crime.
The audience really gets the feeling of poverty and grime.
I think the casting was brilliant for this film.
My only beef is with the overlong running time.
The harshness of the landscape is particularly fitting to the souls of the characters.
Irene Papas is the modern quintessence of classic Greek plays.
It teaches us much about ourselves as individuals and as social and political creatures.
Another conflict raised in the film is that between the Church and the State.
It relies more upon depicting reality in a very grim and sober light.
To say the least it was probably a bit alarming.
I think this is a very satisfying ending for several reasons.
The movie could had easily ended 15 minutes earlier.
it occurs that it is not.
They range from tasteful erotic images to purely technical shots.
His desires show him totally different direction.
They are both very convincing.
But in contrast to Giovanna he questions the committed crime on a moral level.
But then the last sequences make this carefully built construct of ideas collapse.
they keep coming up with films Ive never heard of .
the Italian version of The Postman Always Rings Twice.
This Italian version is different .
more realistic and with a very different ending.
see it watch it.
street scenes and lifestyle glimpses alone are worth watching.
This masterpiece ends in a tragic way.
My vote is ten.
Giovanna is one of the best creations in Ms.
The last sequence of the film shows Ms.
Finally Gino has steady employment.
The acting and direction were both uniformly good throughout.
The two novellas seem like they must be very similar.
Gino is very unenthusiastic about this idea.
Their relationship quickly crumbles.
This is a really fun movie.
But this is where the resemblance stops.
Seriously pushed forward the theme of the last episode even more.
I have to agree with everyone else that has posted.
He does have a cool character.
The guy who finds it necessary to howl.
The hour long chase at the end involving the teacher and the priest.
This movie is great.
Great characters and great lines.
Sally Field is so over the top.
this is what I love about good comedies.
I would love to know how the idea for this movie came up.
He passes by without a word.
And then only too little and too late.
The film chronicles his efforts at finding out more about the woman.
He pieces more and more of her life together.
He has to make things right.
I'm tired of the same old stuff in movies.
I'm tired of the same old stuff in movies.
I'm tired of the same old stuff in movies.
I highly recommend catching this film.
This is NOT a horror flick.
I really felt for Jake.
Here the film is very successful in getting its theme across.
It was on right after Bay City Rollers.
This show is decidedly low tech.
But kids love this stuff.
This is drama and comedy spread on with a trowel.
This is why I still have nightmares.
A boy leaves on a magical journey to an island.
Not suitable for children.
I grew up with H.
This movie is not limited to children either.
The music in this movie suited Jack Wild and Mama Cass beautifully.
growing up still love it today i am 46 years old.
I absolutely LOVED this movie when I was a kid.
I cried every time I watched it.
I totally identified with the characters.
I loved Jack Wilde.
I can still remember the characters vividly.
The film and its actors won several awards.
I highly recommend it.
Otherwise it would be a perfect 10.
I would recommend not drinking anything that would sting coming out your nose.
This movie was excellent.
This is a graphic movie.
So it is Donald Sutherland who walks away with the picture.
Those who speak Hungarian will recognize the many Hungarian accents and credits.
So do some soldiers.
Nor do killers learn regret if they are dead.
I was surprised at how fascinating this movie was.
This is an excellent movie.
Very satisfying and not exploitative about the crimes at all.
He is driven to find and stop the killer.
The locations and sets are perfect recreations of latter day Soviet life.
This is truly a movie that covers several themes simultaneously.
This a film not to be missed.
The photography was good too.
His anguish at not being able to stop the deaths is palpable.
I believe this is the most powerful film HBO Pictures has made to date.
A masterpiece of the genre.
The devotion to duty of the main character was masterfully portrayed by Rea.
You can feel the suffering of the dedicated people who labored in that system.
He murdered 56 people over 8 years in the former Soviet Union.
Rea makes us feel for this man.
All around a very well done movie with fine performances and a great screenplay.
9 out of 10 stars.
HBO has furnished us with an excellent film in an unusual manner.
Congrats to the director and editor of this great piece.
It is in my Top 10 Must see list.
The concept of becoming a serial killer in a communist system is illogical .
But hardly anyone has done it so well.
This is a quality film.
The subject matter is at once grim and gripping.
This is a truly remarkable piece of cinematic achievement.
An HBO product for t.
and it takes place in Russia.
There are only two short action scenes but they are horrific.
There are some excellent comments and observations on this film.
He is the objective.
This is one damn fine film.
This movie tells an amazing story with history and compassion.
Interpol relations and how the agencies work together are also great.
Not overly done either.
How the police work with the political party being what it was.
It is truly fascinating and frustrating.
The settings are beautiful.
HBO has hit the jackpot here.
This film is compelling from the first moment until the last.
They had photos of him sitting in his cage while being prosecuted in court.
This was too good to be made for TV.
I can go either way on material like that.
But the atmosphere of the film is decent.
Merino exploits this fact by incorporating a decent amount of nudity.
I used to pretend to be a bad TV soap actor with my girlfriend.
They do not do that at all in Soap Dish.
Oscar Levant and Leslie Caron I can take or leave.
well it is not really there.
The acting is also not so smooth by Caron.
Few films have so elegantly and succinctly shown two people falling in love.
The film was inspired by the 1928 orchestral composition by George Gershwin.
Gene Kelly directed the brief fantasy dance sequences shown as Lise is introduced.
He used space and time imaginatively.
The ballet in An American in Paris may be his best work.
So Freed went to studio head Louis B.
Well the financial guys finally gave in and signed the checks.
As feel good musicals go it is definitely in the top 10.
An American in Paris is a showcase of Gene Kelly.
The song and dance routines are all perfection.
It won two Academy Awards for Best Picture of 1951 and Best Screenplay.
The story of an American painter in Paris who tries to make it big.
I enjoyed this film.
You can see that MGM was showing off Technicolor.
There are hardly any colors that do not appear in this film.
Every scene is packed full.
The choreography was great.
Gene Kelly is a wonder.
He is so talented.
He understands that the dances can tell the story as much as anything else.
Few American composers have had a better gift for melody.
Ira Gershwin is definitely one of the greatest lyric writers.
He is so witty and charming.
This was a highly entertaining film.
It left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days.
You want the audience to be fully aware of his deficiencies.
But it serves the same function in the plot.
Same with the art show.
I guess it is in the eye of the beholder.
The two films are actually closely linked.
movie after the Ballet ended.
The film literally left me in the lurch.
Gene Kelly came up with some really grand ideas for musicals while with MGM.
Gershwin got the kind of deal for Gershwin music that Irving Berlin normally got.
Two women are interested in him.
At one point Kelly dances on top of the baby grand piano.
So it happened that way.
But this one topped them all.
I guess fantasy trumped realism that year.
Big budgets also have an upper hand in these things as well.
Their romantic love affair sparkles as brightly as the City of Lights itself.
He even applauds to himself as members of the audience.
Kelly seems to defy the boundaries of his physical self.
The film gave us a wealth of memories to take home.
This film is possibly disturbing in many aspects.
Parsifal journeys into the 19th and 20th century throughout the film.
The tempting Flower Maidens are in the nude.
Warner and Nat Pendleton.
Exciting cinematic suspense in both these scenes.
I have been a fan of this movie for years and years.
to name a few.
all give splendid performances.
Must have been a set that was used in many a subsequent film.
Nicely done and passes the time in an entertaining manner.
Van Dine must have been a shrewd businessman in dealing with Hollywood.
Only Tarzan seemed to get around Hollywood more.
MGM produced the Garden Murder Case and starred Edmund Lowe as the fashionable detective.
Mayer decided to concentrate him there.
I will say this though.
A warm family film to enjoy.
It proves that the dreams of an adolescent can truly come true.
A great storyline with a message.
The editing is first rate.
This is a great movie to see with your girlfriend.
We had to get it.
An excellent family movie.
gives a lot to think on.
Everything is just perfect.
The acting is alright.
I first saw this film during and International Film Studies course.
You will still be laughing at it when the disc wears out.
It will reward the attentive and sensitive viewer.
It is a beautifully filmed human story.
The final few scenes are powerful but depressing.
None of the scenes felt gratuitous or out of the place.
Anyone growing up in the South would experience the same things.
Even a glance is forbidden.
There are no words needed.
Their facial expressions say everything.
She really can not see this dance.
They can not even get undressed for bed by themselves.
Their racist attitudes will be erased with their presence.
I think I would like to visit this Africa.
Because there is no real story here.
But I was truly enraptured by its quiet pacing and by the glorious ending.
He says that when he came he wanted to call everyone brother.
This is an amazing film to watch or show young people.
The Whites are all the bosses and they expect Black servitude without question.
till HBO began rerunning it this month.
Cathy Moriarty steals the show in my opinion.
all turn in superb performances as expected.
So 10 it is.
Most students had trouble understanding the end of the film.
The household is divided into public and private spaces.
Personally I liked Greensleeves and the other harsher characters.
They had some of the more amusing lines.
One of the most unheralded great works of animation.
Sorry to disappoint everyone.
I do not watch soaps.
My grandmother still watches that one with the hour glass.
But this movie takes parody and spells it a new way.
I found the story pretty damn funny.
I went and saw Rivers and Tides again today.
To Blake Art was a War.
He would rather have only the images and the wonderful soundtrack.
So I was aware of that as I watched this second time.
Be a Trend setter.
This film is mesmerizing in its beauty and creativity.
This movie is probably for you.
it combines nature and art in a minimal way as it is in itself.
this is overall a great piece of work in every aspect.
it has no boundaries as far as age goes.
This film is stunningly beautiful.
I strongly recommend this movie to everyone.
I can think of nothing else to say about it.
The music set to the film is embracing and intoxicating.
I for one am glad to know that Andy is somewhere out there.
He makes art from objects he finds in nature.
The work seems to be more of a process than a goal.
But do go if you have the opportunity.
There are also several books available with photographs of his sculptures.
It is an experience purely of time and form.
Greetings again from the darkness.
Insight into the mind and motivation of a wonderful artist.
How strange for most of us to see someone who MUST work.
I beg to differ.
The process of creation and destruction.
Of emergence and disappearing.
This is a romantic comedy with the emphasis on comedy for a change.
As a romantic counterpoint or foil to the leads are Robert Downey Jr.
But see this for Sally Field who is outstanding.
I can understand not wanting to hear him talk through the movie.
But The Shootings Did Leave And Effect.
The structure and execution of the film was fantastic.
Cal and Andre were phenomenal as the two disturbed classmates.
Very powerful and intense.
the end shooting sequence leaves you speechless because it is almost too realistic.
I really hope it gets the attention it deserves.
If you have got the chance you really should see it.
normal kids with normal families.
I was lucky enough to see Zero Day last night.
A very disturbing one at that.
Just your average kids.
They plan to shoot up there High School.
The movie is very chilling.
You really need to see it yourself.
This is the best movie I have come across in a long while.
He filmed it using teenage actors who were still attending high school.
It is almost artful.
and the tension in the final minutes of the movie is excruciating.
There is only one aspect of ZERO DAY that troubled me.
Yet these boys do not really seem angry.
They showed their life for about a year.
And THAT gives me the chills.
Of course I was.
I got to like them.
But I knew they were.
And that is why I can not go to sleep right now.
This movie is about a fictional soap opera.
It is very fast and funny.
To say anything else would ruin the movie.
There are several plots and sub plots in the movie.
They all gives over the top performances.
This movie is favorite of mine from the year 1991.
They showed their life for about a year.
And THAT gives me the chills.
Of course I was.
I got to like them.
But I knew they were.
And that is why I can not go to sleep right now.
I can honestly say it was very interesting indeed.
The problem is that little in terms of emotion is directly delivered.
The movie is amazing.
It feels like you are watching something that actually happened.
This movie is one for the ages.
Society left them behind and the consequences are horrifying and real.
Respect and love your fellow man.
It seems hard to really pinpoint.
They turn fantasy into tragedy.
Yet he is in his own way dominant.
Cal placates Andre and encourages him.
Whilst Cal has found someone offering him a way out.
The movie certainly picks up pace and improves as it nears its grim conclusion.
There is an excellent moment when Cal attends the high school prom.
We feel like shunning the masses as they have.
The penultimate scene is superb.
It is all too real and truly creates a sense of impending doom.
It is a character study well worth experiencing.
zero day is based of columbine high school massacre.
and its a video diary of two boys.
they is a lot to say about this movie.
the two boys act like they are in a weird cult.
they burn all there stuff.
so thats my review on zero day.
and lets just say the end shooting scene is messed up.
It really put things in perspective as I watched it.
This film would not have worked in any other format.
It also reminds us of the media storm that followed after.
This movie is a fictional version of our dreams coming true.
We get to see the kid behind the monster.
Misunderstood by some and picked on by others.
But together they stand and all will pay.
The first movie in years that left me absolutely staggered.
But then not all killers are raving lunatics foaming at the mouth.
They are just wired differently.
And that is perhaps the most chilling thought of all.
The characters are real human beings with logic and reasons behind their actions.
You get to understand them.
Overall though a really good movie on a very tough topic.
Their parents just think the guys are filming for a family home video.
I just came back from the Montreal premiere of Zero Day.
I understand how can young kids can be driven to do such horror.
High schools have became battle fields of conformity.
You need to fight your way into being like the others.
Cal expressed it well.
Drama is everywhere and it can take every shape.
and a scary one that might get to other kids.
Flawed but honest with a terrible honesty.
Especially the last scenes were almost painful to watch.
Hope it gets the distribution it deserves.
I rented Zero Day from the local video store last week.
I had never heard of the film and I had my reservations about it.
Zero Day is a phenomenal film.
It leaves you thinking about the lives involved.
And it leaves you perplexed how people get to this point.
The material in the film is disturbing.
This is not mainstream Hollywood and there is no happy ending.
this film is builds up solidly and it keeps you going.
The music is very different but very good.
Virginia begins to question just what is growing inside of her.
Brooke Adams stars as Virginia.
There they meet Dr.
It is fantastic on more levels than I can remember.
Love this film also.
It was really crowded and it was a very ambitious atmosphere to.
I can totally understand why nobody else ever tried to do something like this.
There already is something like this.
Detractors of this series tend to argue that it is formulaic and hopelessly dated.
and then kills it.
This is a classic that has somehow slipped through the cracks.
It fits the soap opera with it is flamboyant and melodramatic air.
D set coming out.
so many of them seem new all over again.
They just do not make stuff like this these days.
Great stories and a great cast and nothing else to weigh it down.
It works on both levels.
It truly gets better with age.
Never should have been on Fridays in the first place.
ABC had huge problems with Friday nights.
Watch it and weep.
10 out of 10.
You were scared for him and for the other characters too.
I could not even purchase the Jeff Rice novels.
Then something wonderful happened.
My twelve year old self would have adored it.
I am glad that the show was never revived though.
Without Oakland it would not have been the same.
I have the Rice books now and have read them several times.
What you do not see is sometimes more frightening than what you do.
you had to be there at the time but it was an interesting idea.
It is interesting and unusual to observe the diversity of opinion here.
This was made for them.
Perhaps some reviewers are taking it too seriously.
You can do a lot with a little cash.
Blair Witch proved that.
This film supports it.
It is no more than a sitcom in length and complexity.
I have recommended this film to all of my friends.
Sure wish he would make more films.
There also several visual gags that are quite ahead of their time.
The quintessential road movie.
The acting and direction were terrific.
In fact everything in the film seemed to flow except for the script.
This is one of the funniest movies I have seen.
This is a smaller film and I am willing to forgive minor things.
I enjoyed the acting of all of the major players.
This movie is awesome for three main reasons.
It is esthetically beautiful.
I absolutely loved that.
Sometimes they fall into clichés but this one does not.
There is a mix of humor and emotion throughout the film.
I like the end a lot.
And of course it is all about the Magician theme .
I rented this movie from blockbuster on a whim .
i guess i got lucky .
i laughed from beginning to end .
Miriam Hopkins and Claude Rains give wonderful performances.
Hopkins was a beautiful actress who really makes us feel for Mrs.
The driving force for Mrs.
The real merit of the picture is the cast.
Perhaps Lady with Red Hair contains his best work in films.
See it and enjoy him.
Still this slasher yarn offers plenty of nasty violence and gore.
Steers who plays the villain is fairly threatening.
The desert locations provide some atmosphere and the gore is rather strong.
8 out of 10.
I would give it 6.
5 out of 10.
A couple of the murders are indeed extremely macabre.
There are some surprisingly good performances on display from an extremely inexperienced cast.
The divine Jennifer McAllister does a superb job as the heroine and B.
Steers portrays off his rocker dementia with finesse.
But I do not know.
They are the underlying strength of the film.
You got things to say.
Told you 158 times I can not stand little notes on my pillow.
This movie is like strawberries dipped in chocolate.
A joy from start to finish.
Now THAT is only in the first few minutes.
This was the first time I would seen the always charming Teri Hatcher.
These men have great jobs though.
7 out of 10.
This film really works.
The supporting cast for this film is stellar as well.
It is about 2 men living together who are from opposite planets.
The script bristles with humor from this situation.
This had been done in some forms previously.
This is the one that brings it all together in a very good package.
It is hard to imagine Simon ever topping this.
He seems to have every health condition in the book.
Running throughout the movie are references to marriage.
Their friendship becomes an inadvertent hellish relationship.
The beginning 20 minutes are very boring.
The original film is still very good.
and laugh out loud funny in many scenes.
She calls Oscar and lets him know what happened.
After some side splitting hysterics it is agreed Felix will stay with Oscar.
I think that this is possibly the funniest movie I have ever seen.
easily surpassing the stage and screen versions of the tale.
The script is good.
And all in one scene.
What can I say.
this is a wonderful film that I can watch over and over.
It is definitely one of the top ten comedies made.
It is real to life situation done perfectly.
The joke is usually on themselves as oppose to passing the joke onto another.
Nicely photographed and directed.
The Odd Couple is a comic gem.
Thats when the fun begins.
It has a great cast who each give great performances.
Especially Sally Field and Kevin Kline.
No one delivers these lines better.
No one times them better.
Nobody does it better.
This cordial comedy confronts a few bizarre characters.
So he tries to kill himself but every attempt fails.
He offers his distressed friend Felix a new home in his apartment.
He cleans and cooks the whole time.
Filmed in a theatrical way and excellent acted.
He is the perfect clown.
The film is full of such amusing and at the same time touching scenes.
So there you have it.
Simply one of the best comedies and films ever.
It is I would venture one of the greatest comic films of all times.
The script is so sharp that you need to staunch the bleeding.
The story is well known and has already been described in other comments.
Ultimately it is not really possible to say anything else.
A FROLICS OF YOUTH Short Subject.
The abandoned spaniel he finds helps to change his mind.
As soon as he saw a dog in need he overcame his fear.
Years ago I did follow a soap on TV.
Many congrats to all who made it.
All is peaceful until a flea comes bouncing by.
The mutt is hilarious as he reacts to the flea.
The joke proved unintentionally prophetic.
Impressive during this course of history was what led to the struggle.
I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in World War II history.
and it is pretty interesting.
This is a good movie.
It tries to be the epic adventure of the century.
It more has the same feeling that a old Errol Flynn movie had.
You just can not hate it.
I think it is an okay adventure movie.
And I really love the soundtrack.
This was a really cool movie.
It reminds me of the story of Anne Frank.
She is cast very well as Hanna and immediately has our sympathy.
The second half of the film is the most interesting and tragic one.
The movie is filmed very good.
The music is good.
This is a very good and thrilling film.
Sadly a complete version of this may never get a decent release.
The English dubbing severely hurts the movie.
I do not understand.
Explain to me again how this is.
It is an incoherent mess.
It might have been a solo.
Rank amateur directing there.
But its a setup for a twisted scientific experiment to unleash his inner beast.
Post production was a nightmare.
Then its raining again.
And yet you do not look at it as a gaffe.
You can find it for free at Archive.
The world lost a great artist this month.
I absolutely LOVE this movie and would really like to have it someday.
His sister packs him some food and he goes.
This movie was great and I would like to buy it.
The boy goes with his grandfather to catch a young eagle.
the boy saves the eagle from being killed and runs away from the tribe.
Please if anyone knows where I can buy this movie let me know.
I still remember one of the opening lines.
He lived with his sister so and so in the village.
He gets to live the way he always wanted to.
He gets to soar the heavens.
There were some interesting films.
I was more of a movie goer then.
I have been searching for this film for years.
It was truly inspiring.
I too did not remember the Disney film.
I did not even remember that it was an opening film for Disney.
I truly wish they would show this on TV sometime.
And I was very impressed by it.
I remember that an Indian boy was friends with an eagle.
This impressed me very much.
As an eagle he was still wearing his turquoise necklace.
He has asked if it were possible for me to get this for him.
Since we have Indian blood he connects to this movie.
The story and images of this movie have been burned into my memory.
I loved it and want my kids to see it.
What a great story this really was.
I think it is only available on VHS.
What a wonderful era this was.
This is a good movie.
With pretty good performances.
If you like Falling down you are going to enjoy this one.
The story has been told before.
A deadly disease is spreading around.
He is indeed a desperate person just going home to see his child.
This person could be working next to you.
This is by far the most consistently hilarious comedy I have ever seen.
I can quote this movie for hours on end.
Piece of subtle art.
Doubtlessly a special story about the ambiguity of existence.
Images of Trial and same ambiguous woman.
Hypocrisy is a mask.
The acting by all of these actors is very good.
Hurt and Weller are really excellent in this film.
I thought that they performed good.
The thrills is really good and some of it is surprising.
The movie is filmed very good.
The music is good.
This is a very good and thrilling film.
Now some years later he is now in Russia or someplace.
Now as I said before this film is a lot like Falling Down.
SHE is famous for cursing a priest which came true.
which does happen at the end of the movie.
cable network while I was flipping channels.
The premise is reasonably simple.
Just that is more of snail mail.
Very slow snail mail.
This is a great film.
The cinematography is gorgeous and there are a number of big name actors.
This movie helps to image those kinds of stories and memories.
Some people just do not get it.
Kline and Fields are great.
Just a lot of fun.
Very good acting and script.
Very touching as well for the spiritually mature.
Not for people who do not like to think.
She soon discovers that she has nowhere to go.
This not very well known picture is well written and acted.
The location is breathtaking.
This film gives some insight of Japanese culture here and across the ocean.
Distortion is a movie that sort of caught me by surprise.
His wife has no idea that this is happening.
The detective hired by the playwright becomes a character in the play.
The premise is simple.
This is one of the best thrillers of 2005.
A great eye candy.
This could be the best.
They have a couple of drinks and end up sitting together on the plane.
And what does this have to with Lisa.
Definitely worth the see.
The emotions was in right choose.
Idea and script of this movie is great too.
The doctor ends up renting her a house and buying her a car.
o such foolishness here.
Yes you see a few characters but they really only interact with the principals.
Such as the husband wife at the motel whose room was canceled.
The bad guy in particular needs her in the beginning of the flight.
The rude guy in the airport was important to the movie too.
She thinks what she can do to stall time.
Any other movie the smart executive women would be acting like idiots.
But not this one.
Was Craven should do more of these types of movies.
Also one last comment.
He is completely unrecognizable.
I was bored one night and Red Eye was on and thought why not.
Red Eye is one of the best movies in a long time.
I mean I just got into the movie cause it was just so brilliant.
The story is new and different.
Red Eye is just phenomenal.
Nothing more and nothing less.
I give Red Eye 9 out of 10.
I will not give anything away.
Then we move on to where Jack is chasing Lisa in the airport.
There is nearly twelve minutes of violence and strong intensity throughout that entire scene.
Not only was the movie intense but it had a great plot to it.
Red Eye I have to say is better than 10 out of 10 stars.
thrilling as I found it.
I rather tended to forget I was watching a movie.
That says a lot.
The death of her grandmother sends her on a flight which delayed several times.
a flight where she meets Jack.
She succeeds in saving them.
A great thrill ride all the way through.
Wes Craven depicts the story of a regular hotel worker Lisa.
Then this is when the horror starts.
This is an excellent example of a bone shaking production.
Wes Craven did well with this film.
that will stay with you for weeks.
I will leave it at that.
Red Eye is a good little thriller to watch on a Saturday night.
This movies strongest point is its cast.
This film needed good actors to deliver the dialog and thrills.
We had Rachel McAdams from Mean Girls and Wedding Crashers.
The pacing in this film was great.
Much better then the other flight movie Flight Plan.
Not too long and not too shabby.
Greetings again from the darkness.
Craven even has a cameo as one of the passengers on the plane.
She is a natural.
WES CRAVEN is at his best ever.
He brings us an amazing end of summer thriller I was so desperately craving.
This is THE thriller of the year.
All the actors are amazing and the action is realistic and fun.
It steadily built suspense.
I was on the edge of my seat most of the movie.
The film is very fast pace and exciting with no slow or boring spots.
Wes Craven does a really good job behind the camera.
Red Eye really shows his skills at storytelling.
Red Eye also works well because of its young and talented cast.
Rachel McAdams gives a very engaging performance and her character is hard to hate.
You may even end up cheering for her out loud.
The way he acts charming at first but then turns psycho is especially impressive.
There are a few unrealistic moments that may distract the viewer.
If you expect a horror movie then you will end up disappointed.
Had me on the edge of my seat.
But these folks were probably right to keep the movie so tightly focused.
as I'm not sure it makes a great deal of sense.
Just sit back and enjoy.
No cheap make up.
As always she delivers an entertaining and convincing performance.
Wes finally gets it right.
I had fun watching Red Eye.
At least not another Scream with the usual college killer.
I saw an advanced screening for this movie tonight.
I absolutely loved it.
The movie kept me on the edge of my seat all night.
He played his character very well.
Rachel McAdams was great.
The suspense is held through out the movie.
I was not disappointed in the end.
The trailer does not do the movie justice.
The movie is much better than the trailer indicated.
Do not wait for this movie to come out on video.
75 to see it.
Hitchcock understood that people go the the movies to have a good time.
Something that Hollywood seems to have forgotten in recent years.
Rachel McAdams is wonderful as always.
The directing is surprising stylish.
The story is good but the dialog could have used some sprucing up.
I'm quite functional in my personal and professional life.
Many addicts have suffered miserable abuse.
Some kids simply respond badly to divorce.
Often it is those of us with smaller issues who suffer the longest.
This is followed by an intervention which is then followed by an outcome.
This makes the positive outcomes all the better.
Another thing I like about the show is the quality of the camera work.
Now for the bad.
The film is stunning.
It is a crude portrait of the city.
Or it is like The Brave One.
A film that shocks and hits you in the guts very hard.
Leaves you shaking and stunned.
Four of the best filmmakers in the contemporary Mexican cinema.
A surprisingly good cast.
If you had an assault without a scratch then you are lucky.
And it is a beautiful life in Mexico.
I nearly puked when I saw some of the images.
The recreation of a similar situation in this film shocked me deeply.
Those are meaningless compared with the actions of the people.
With a few exceptions they are all perfect examples of human rubbish.
The music by A.
I saw this movie when it first came out.
This is not your ordinary psycho movie.
Lots of interesting and original slants on the genre.
A most awaited film of the year 2002.
Its a good entertaining movie and gives good messages also.
I will rate this movie as Good instead of Excellent because of the screenplay.
Its a must watch movie.
Lexi is admitted to hospital.
This film shows it as it is.
She gets better and then has a drawback.
I think this movie shows all of that very well.
There should be more movies like this.
The product is one of the most beautiful and unique films in recent memory.
This film is not in black and white.
But lurking in the distance are the vikings.
Forget what you think you know about this film you are wrong.
Its a simple story with so much more going on.
There is death and destruction and joy and happiness.
Its not sugar coated.
Its a film that looks unlike any other.
the Images are designed to fill the available space as much as possible.
Its stunningly beautiful and best described as art come to life.
I can not say more than that.
Its one of the best animated films I have ever run across.
And the comic relief is sometimes a bit too broad.
But these are minor problems with an otherwise delightful and superbly imaginative film.
The cast is excellent I think.
It felt like a slight acid trip.
I figured I was just missing a piece of Irish history.
I originally thought the animation was flat and boring.
The edges of the screen become framed in decorated moving triangles or circles.
This is one of them.
Brendan is not fond of the wall and neither are the other monks.
One day a traveler comes from the island of Iona near Scotland.
Aidan has special plans for Brendan.
There are things worse than Vikings out there.
The animation here contains a lot of similar designs and patterns.
It enhances the film.
We are reminded of it is importance but never fully understand.
That was really the only lacking portion of the film.
Otherwise I thought the story was interesting though completely outdone by the animation.
I guess that is okay to a certain degree.
The animation can carry a film so far before it falls short.
I think it will help your viewing experience a lot more.
This a very impressive and beautifully illustrated film that should definitely not be missed.
The reds used in the Viking invasion sequence is unforgettably haunting.
Try to catch this quiet gem of a film.
You fall in love with the characters from the moment you meet them.
The groundswell of support amongst our animation community is phenomenal.
I'm here to tell you now it is been worth the wait.
May there be many more.
The startling conclusion packs a mean and lingering wallop right to the gut.
A solid and satisfying winner.
I love the pace of the show and the fast upbeat music.
just incredible considering what an monumentally difficult race it is.
You are all wonderful.
If you loved Long Way Round you will enjoy this nearly as much.
Ewan makes a few appearances but Charley really pulls it off alone.
It is a motorcycle movie though and anyone on two wheels will love this.
The series features stunning photography as well as a few interviews of peoples mouths.
Great to see him with Ewan again.
As for their being no mention of it on the package.
They should have given it a 15 just for the language alone.
Wonderful location shooting in Hawaii.
The photography and the compositions are excellent.
Bow settles her hash fast.
Popping in a CD has it is advantages.
Except in the Twilight Zone.
It has a good plot and it is unique.
This movie also has a very good ending.
the list goes on.
There was one slight disappointment for me however.
you get the picture.
Well to the actual plot of the film.
This movie i have been dying to see.
Well it took till now to decide to actually rent it.
It was completely worth it.
This movie made me laugh from the beginning to the end.
Chris Rock is funny no matter which movie he is in.
Great movie when I saw it.
Have to say one of my favorite movies of all time.
Also the thought of how the movie goes is a nice way of thinking.
I like the movie overall so i give it a.
but I saw past that flaw and saw a solid comedy.
This movie is a remake of two movies that were a lot better.
This one is not so great.
It all seems real fake and the editing is just bad.
I do not know how they could release this movie like that.
Because I absolutely loved it and found it to be a little hidden treasure.
I really can not think of anything bad to say about it.
But I found all the characters very intriguing and sympathetic.
But I guess the title already kind of gives that away.
I have seen this film several times.
they run a close comparison and definitely are more modern to reach people.
I have seen this movie a whole dozen times and it is awesome.
I think that it would be interesting to do a remake of it.
Hard for any girl to look good with him.
Europa is probably the differential for its greatness in visual terms.
This is what he offers to us constantly through his work over and over.
I have read most of the comments on this movie.
No one got scared or traumatized like I have read on some posts.
The movie is just based on biblical facts.
back then there were only 4 or 5 TV stations to choose from.
The Vietnam war was just over.
There will still be 7 years before Star Wars comes out.
They just needed to find an excuse and blamed A Thief In The Night.
No one can ever blame themselves because they are always right.
Just like these whiners who complain about the movie.
These people must be full grown adults.
Something new is always good.
Trust your own instincts.
This is a great movie.
If you can see this movie.
I think the U.
will play a major role in the world government to come.
The last days are lining up with the Bible.
The viewer is able to watch the show without being distracted by sloppy craftsmanship.
The message of the movie is superb.
I plan on showing it to my teen group at church.
The fashion in the movie was exactly the same fashion of its time.
Overall a good episode.
What used to terrify me in junior high now makes me laugh.
It even has the SAME EXACT score of Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
I think I'm the only person in history to make that observation.
I saw myself acting out just like her.
Anyone who has struggled with manic depression could get so much from this movie.
Never mind about if it showed her awards or what they were for.
That is not the issue here.
It was so real.
It was like watching myself up there on screen.
I wish I could thank Ms.
I have a lot of respect for her as a person.
It is unfortunate that when a celebrity suffers that is what helps people most.
I always thought she was great and always will.
I am glad that she wrote this book and that the movie was made.
She is a remarkable lady and I hope she continues to act.
She has been through a lot and has faced it.
The movie was so moving to me that I was very touched.
She was a household name in America by age 15.
The plot is flyweight.
Television horror film hostess Elvira dreams of success in Las Vegas.
Actress Cassandra Peterson has to this date ridden on that success.
Her agent Manny proves a disappointment.
Her voluptuous figure and winning personality soon draws the youth of the town.
And the breasts of Cassandra Peterson become a character of their own.
Someone posted that it could be better written and it could be.
But with a horror host instead of a lawyer.
Sadly it is a wasted opportunity.
With just a bit more writing it could be a classic.
Apart from the obvious reasons.
It would have been great to see their relationship flourish.
Elvira herself is always fun and engaging.
Every time she smiles you will too.
The sort of person you would let look after your kids.
I would recommend giving it a go.
Just do not expect too much.
The other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons.
They just do not make movies like this anymore.
But the uptight townspeople of Falwell are in for a treat.
How can one not forget Daniel Greene once you have seen.
Even Robert Rodriguez could not have made that shot look any better.
but its not all that easy.
hope you like it in total i will have to give it a 0.
com if you wanna.
And yet another run of South Park comes to an end.
Another inspired South Park moment.
Now we must wait until October for the next batch of episodes.
I think that this movie is very fun and horror.
I love Elvira and I like this movie.
I think that she is amazing actress with big.
Cassandra Peterson is one of my favorite comedy actresses.
You can rely on me.
But the fact that I remember it speaks volumes.
One more rewrite for the ending was needed.
um past revealing her enormous.
There are many references made to the wizard of oz throughout the movie.
she and her uncle both quote lines relevant to their parallel characters.
This film is pure Elvira and shows her at her breast.
I mean that in a good way though.
The supporting characters were pretty shallow and mediocre.
She is lovable and adorable.
Cassandra Petersen has a world of acting talent that just glows in this movie.
Few men could disagree with that.
I had a smile ear to ear from the first scene to the last.
I wish they had made a dozen more Elvia movies.
Also check out ELVIRA'S HAUNTED HILLS.
It will not shake the world or change movies forever.
What it will do is entertain.
There are never enough.
He exudes a wonderful refined malice.
I could find no technical faults.
The execution is as close to flawless as the art form gets.
This tender beautifully crafted production delved deep down bitter sweet into my being.
Mr Harvey is experiencing much pain throughout .
Harvey during a school field trip to Salisbury Cathedral.
The cathedral accomplishes its goal.
This is a very powerful and very inspiring movie.
The resolution between the graffiti boy and the Muslim was gratifying but less believable.
if you have a chance of seeing this film do see it.
in my opinion it is a piece of art.
I do not know why it was so fantastic but it simply was.
So many of the characters were so real.
A fine effort for an Australian show.
but it is reminiscent of early secret life of us.
lets hope the show keeps improving with each episode.
I can safely say I'm now glad that I did.
It is a satire of how people treat the homeless.
He dropped the Big Pass in more ways than one.
this film explores that and more.
Succeeds on Many Levels.
The fateful game took place in 1972.
That means that the protagonists graduated in 1972.
But almost all of the music played at the dances etc.
The film did not do well at the box office.
I saw it in a sneak preview.
I have always enjoyed the film.
Robin did well with his role.
I am not a football fan or a real sports fan.
Spoiler This movie is about such a concept.
Russel plays the ex jock who peaked in high school.
A great reverse tragedy.
The Best of Times is one of the great sleepers of all time.
There is lots of sentimentality.
The cast also includes many great supporters.
The fight spread outside the ring and Noble threw his girlfriend into the challenger.
Brock pulled himself together and began to take charge.
Stephanie McMahon stepped out to issue her own pitch.
She said the two of them were once unstoppable and they can be again.
Triple H said that was a tempting offer.
The Canadians took over from there.
Edge tagged in soon after and dropped both opponents.
Test raced down and took down Hogan then leveled Edge with a boot.
The Rock retaliated by latching on the ankle lock to Kurt Angle.
Taker picked Rock up and crashed him with the Last Ride.
He dropped the Big Pass in more ways than one.
Great fun for anyone wishing to enjoy their youth again.
I guess that everyone has to make a comeback at some point.
But Williams and Russell are actually a pretty good comedy team.
This movie surprisingly had a lot of good twists and turns.
This movie has everything you want from an action movie.
Does this sounds cheesy.
Of course it is.
You could argue about the twists being predictable.
But more about the journey to that moment.
8 out of 10.
This movie surprised me in a good way.
Things get more complicated as nobody seldom tells the truth about things.
Made men is well worth checking out.
But especially Timothy Dalton plays a very good roll as the Sheriff.
Great entertainment from start to the end.
Some twists and many action scenes.
and that taxidermy has to do with stuffing animals.
Please do not ruin this great piece by your simple mindedness.
The reasons are far more complex than the single thing you mentioned.
Please read the book as is it a great source of information.
I enjoyed it a lot.
This book is even a taught as a text book at some universities.
Not to my ear.
Additionally there is a good music video.
The ending was quick though.
It ended off quickly which was perfect for this match.
Easily the match of the year.
This is by far the best triple threat match i have ever seen.
No one could predict who would come out of this one.
They say documentary presents information which is taught in middle school.
Neither did I see native peoples portrayed as poor little innocent things.
The common denominator here is the awesome House Band.
Get those boys a good lead singer and they are going places.
This is almost typical Lynch.
The performances are great and the short is thought provoking.
Many questions are left unanswered and this ignites the imagination.
Another brilliant effort from Lynch.
I really think that people are taking the wrong approach at this one.
I just take it for what it is.
I think the suspense and mystery are ingenious in their insinuation upon the watcher.
And in good right.
Lynch is not about that.
At least this side of Lynch is not.
There is diagonal pan.
Zooms also go back and forth sometimes.
This can be felt even in this crappy room.
This is your typical Lynch short.
I am watching the series back to back as fast as possible.
I am attempting to watch all things Star Trek.
Star Trek is the greatest television phenomenon ever achieved.
This portion of the film is almost spot on in that regard.
It just seems so tragic but needs to be told.
Powers Boothe give a commanding performance as the leader Rev.
Jim Jones from obscurity until total madness.
I have seen this film literally over 100 times.
These should be evident to most independent observers.
Many people know how it feels when a loved one is lost.
She wears a flowered dress and apron with a sun hat on her head.
The tragic passing of Ruth affects Will deeply.
They also add a subtle humor to the bittersweet story.
The film is endlessly unpredictable.
Its shot in black and white with shots of color randomly appearing throughout.
This is now a personal favorite film of mine.
Jones physical likeness to Jones is uncanny and the story is acted out chillingly.
The movie keeps you riveted and is a must see for anyone.
A disturbing reflection on human nature and its weaknesses.
Not to let it be repeated again.
Rented the movie as a joke.
I loved the credit at the end of the movie as well.
In short a great movie if you are looking for something to laugh at.
A Great watch for children and adults of all genders.
Puff N Stuff had hinted towards marijuana smoking.
Your kids will love this movie.
I enjoyed it very much as a child.
My father showed me this movie as a child.
Although at the time I had no clue about what those were.
The movie is comedy and adventure.
The storyline is wacky and cheerful.
I and you shall enjoy this together.
Everything was better in past days.
But they are not the only creatures.
After seeing Dick Tracy in the 6.
I do not think you will be disappointed.
This is the perfect film for anybody to watch with their children.
I still liked it though.
She did not belong in this movie and her acting job was pretty bad.
The movie at some points just stood still.
You expected something more and you got nothing.
I did not see Ishtar but I heard bad things.
The reason to watch this movie is the atmosphere.
The costumes and makeup were flawless as well.
The facial makeup for the villains was great.
Of course that movie was much bigger in terms of gross.
Dick Tracy was originally a comic book created in 1931 by Chester Gould.
Go buy it today.
You will not be sorry.
This movies is the best movie to watch for comic book feel.
This is truly one entertaining movie.
Something is wrong with that picture.
Personally I give it a 10.
It is a movie based on a comic book hero.
This movie won more than it is share of awards.
right there tells me it is better than a 5.
If you are looking for pure entertainment be sure to check out Dick Tracy.
Definitely a movie you can watch more than a few times.
I saw Dick Tracy when I was very young.
I sure loved it though.
He or she is very unknown.
I thought that this movie was very colorful and creative.
It was entertaining and fun to watch especially as a child.
Take my word for it.
The film is a continuation of sight gags that are perfectly taken seriously.
I love the bright colors vs.
Beautiful scenery and mood transport you directly into a comic strip environment.
To me it is not bad at all.
The surreal feeling really got me.
Almost all the suits are elaborate in blues and greens and yellows and reds.
The humor is plentiful.
Dick Tracy is one of my all time favorite films.
You will either really love it or really hate it.
It came out a year after the success of Batman.
But its based on a comic strip.
This is one of the best characters Madonna has ever played.
I thoroughly enjoyed this true to form take on the Dick Tracy persona.
Dick Tracy is easily the best comic book based movie made to date.
just sit back with some popcorn and enjoy this one.
Great fun for kids and adults alike.
7 out of 10.
The list is far too long.
Just taking a look at one scene from the film is breathtaking.
I hope she can keep acting and directing.
Check the full credits on the main page and you will amazed.
like nothing you have ever seen.
The whole score was terrible.
I thought I was back in junior high school.
But there were also times when the emotion ran thick.
Nice try on an epic film.
it turned out mediocre though.
I guess you could say I was a little bit disappointed.
You have wonderful animation and at first what seems like a perfect story.
A story about absolutely nothing but a horse in nature.
Very pretty visuals though.
This is a wonderful movie in a lot of ways.
Everyone in my family enjoyed it.
But it is done tastefully and is not offensive at all.
I have loved Disney for years and will continue to do so.
I had the same feeling.
I thoroughly recommend it.
This movie was highly entertaining.
Even more impressive is Brian Adams doing all the songs in French as well.
The score is also uplifting and dramatic.
The result is truly stunning.
The story is compelling and well narrated.
I do not understand anyone who would rank this movie less than a 7.
A man readjusts to life alone after 45 years of marriage.
This was a great movie with a good story.
The music was also fantastic.
This movie really gives you a sense of family and home and friends.
Your kids will love it.
I think you will too.
People I know hate it because Spirit was the only horse that talked.
The drawn animation is a special thing about many animations.
This is what makes the movie so goo.
I liked this movie a lot.
The animation was well done and the romance was cute.
The opening scenery and music were very stirring.
The film is a lament to an America that was once beautiful.
The horse is indeed a fine animal.
The animation is simply stupendous.
Soundtrack too is very impressive.
The wonderful instrumental music lures you to appreciate the movie.
It is one of the best animation flicks i have watched.
Would be a very fine choice on a lonely night.
If only ALL animation was this great.
The characters in this film are beautifully personified.
Charlie is clearly the most interesting figure.
Not one to be missed.
Still the movie has its moments and is quite watchable.
There is at least one funny moment.
Something of a surprise.
The film starts out very well.
The opening commercial is a very nice touch.
I also can not see why anybody would not love Scarface.
this movie is just great.
Montana was all for doing what you wanted to do with your life.
This falls under my top 10 favorite movies.
Definitely a movie you must see.
However the real hero in the story are the bison and the northwest.
This movie has it all.
Great movie and you will probably really enjoy it.
This is still a superb film.
He is the dominant star of this film.
The chainsaw incident is downright brutal and their is blood everywhere.
Of course this is more than just a film about excess.
This is a film about the darker side of the American dream.
In many ways it puts it on a thematic par with The Godfather films.
This IS THE BEST FILM EVER MADE.
I disagree but this movie is very very good.
The psychological effects of what they are doing are well depicted.
This is one of my favorite films of all time.
Murray Abraham and Angel Salazar.
He manages to bring reality to his character that leaves a strong impression.
The supporting cast served its job very well.
Robert Loggia I have always enjoyed watching in just seeing him yell.
Everybody just seemed to fit their roles by being there.
They did not fit in perfectly but were convincing enough.
The writing was great it was just pure Oliver Stone.
That is a testament to him though.
Nobody knows how to write a surreal reality for a movie than Oliver Stone.
The music was good but not that great.
He is not inspiring in anyway.
In a freaky twisted way he is a necessity of our society.
This in no way excuses people like him.
And he will also know whether or not it was worth it.
Tony is upset and nothing can stop him now.
the film has a great supporting cast among them is F.
The movie has a magnificent look to it.
For the rest of you it is highly recommended.
Tony Montana would and did ANYTHING to achieve it.
Tony was living high off the hog.
but it drives the point disturbingly home.
Give me a break.
This movie is entertaining and you will never get bored.
This is a masterpiece and i recommend that you see this.
You will not be disappointed.
A classic is also something that everyone praises but no one has read.
It is praised for all the wrong reasons.
And that is why the film works so well.
Not a promotion of it.
It has great cinematography that pulls you into the story.
The acting is terrific.
These three dig the film as deep as it can go.
Always go into a film unsuspecting.
This is one of my all time favorites.
The Last Hunt is the forgotten Hollywood classic western.
The laugh here is that Bronson used to play Indians.
Today a large remnant bison herd resides in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming.
She looks beautiful and is adequate in her role.
The director does go a bit overboard during a particular part in the climax.
I saw this movie about a week ago and still keep thinking about it.
I was very moved by this movie.
I found the characters very believable and likable almost to a fault.
I found this film to be a fascinating study of a family in crisis.
The film is a character study on how this family deals with its subject.
I loved this movie.
It had great production values.
Beyond the grim statistics are personal stories that we rarely hear about.
Leo tells him that he is ill and Marcel is sad but accepting.
I am still haunted by the final scene.
This is quite a dull movie.
I assume he loves her.
I know the answers do not add up but please take a stand.
It leaves you with a very fine aftertaste.
Its setting is serious.
Its elegant styling never and nowhere puts any weight on your mind.
The casting is impressive.
The latter seasons disastrous reshuffle contributed to its three season short life span.
Plus a comedy about a paparazzi reporter was original to boot.
A lot of things do not make sense to me.
She wants her freedom but it comes at a cost.
Her boss is played by the wonderful and divine Holland Taylor.
if the opportunity arises.
The film really moves along and there is excellent direction and good camera work.
But I have a few complaints.
There are only two false steps in this 1993 film.
He kills both buffalo and Indians for pure pleasure.
The most entrancing points in the movie are the entirely cinematographic ones.
An underwater shot of proliferating blood.
An uncommonly expressive sequence on what it must be like to drown.
Both visually and musically stunning.
A treat for both the eye and the ear.
The dancing of many of the lead artistes is breathtakingly good.
This movies chronicles the life and times of William Castle.
A must see for Castle fans and horror movie fans.
That aside this is just great.
So I hope this documentary acknowledged that.
I look forward to seeing it.
Trevor Howard decides their best course of action is to run for it.
They should have stayed put.
This film plays really well with an audience.
Especially once the chase begins.
The chase that ensues helps bring out the truth.
This is an entertaining film.
Seek it out if you can find it.
The Clouded Yellow is a compact psychological thriller with interesting characterizations.
She is raised by a tribe in Africa.
The point is that A.
it is hilarious until Danny Glover adopts it and it is friend.
Because later he got a job as a writer for numerous prank shows.
But how can you stand to mange a baseball team that can not win.
P hide in a tree to watch the angels play baseball.
This movie was about a couple of orphaned children who wanted a family.
This movie is perfect for families to watch together.
It is a great film and it deserves more credit.
The special effects are stunning and spectacular.
Everyone who has children should share this with theirs.
great for the entire family to watch.
I happened to catch this movie on cable one afternoon.
What I found more interesting was the depiction of the foster family system.
Sidekick Milton Davis Jr.
But that is just nitpicking.
I might as well have the money as well.
This film was pretty good.
are brought in with a variety of talented actors and understanding of the sport.
William Dear and the guys put together a great movie.
I thought that this was reasonably well done.
This movie can also be the interest of avid baseball fans.
I think this is a lovely family movie.
The actors are great and the effects well executed throughout.
All ages will love this movie.
Christopher Lloyd is hilarious and is perfect for the part.
I really enjoyed this movie as a young kid.
That was definitely the case with Angels in the Outfield.
It is also hilarious.
Its an energetic movie.
Therein lies my gripe.
To top it off the setting is beautiful and the cinematography excellent.
find something to believe in.
But this supernatural comedy is still a hilarious and worthwhile entertainment.
My vote is eight.
She adds appropriate body language for comic effect.
In fact it stinks of Curse of the Jade Scorpion.
Being entirely innocent has nothing to do with it nor does unequivocal guilt.
Though the plot seemed old Woody still has a knack for one liners.
I did find his allusions to his last film interesting.
If not watch something else.
The river Styx was pure genius.
This was much better than the newspaper critics made it sound out to be.
Directed by Woody Allen.
He plays the perfect bumbling magician.
There have been a few reviews maligning this movie.
She starts to romance him but quickly falls in love.
It was shorter and moved much more quickly.
I give it an 8.
The two would be P.
s conjure an invitation to a club where Peter Lyman goes to swim.
Allen has taken himself from the romantic lead pawing his gorgeous leading lady.
Both are excellent in their banter throughout the film.
He makes a good appearance in the movie as the man pursuing Ms.
I say give it a chance because you just might like it.
It seems that as directors reach a certain age they really get things right.
The second he walked on screen audience lit up.
Scoop is classic Woody Allen.
I would even say some shades of Hitchcock.
The plot turns are nice and tight.
Less stylized than Mighty Aphrodite.
Less forced than Small Time Crooks or Hollywood Ending.
Woody has finally found a comic voice that works in the 21st century.
Greetings again from the darkness.
What is most striking to us 40 plus year fans is that Mr.
This attraction motivated him to write his best comedy in years.
She is unafraid to look and act like a real person.
especially the banter between Allen and Scarlett.
especially the Strauss composition.
I saw this film about twenty years ago on the late show.
He did not get enough roles like this during his long career.
This is his best performance.
He is totally believable in a truly villainous role.
He basically would just do what MGM gave him.
This film proves that he could have handled more diverse and difficult roles.
This film is definitely worth a look.
Sondra and Sid immediately become a pair of amateur sleuths.
His parents were English.
On a hot day you do not want a heavy meal.
And his body moves pretty fast too.
They were the exception though because everyone else including myself really enjoyed themselves.
If you are a Woody Allen fan you will probably enjoy yourself.
The classical music score is an excellent compliment to the action on screen.
Scarlett Johanson looks gorgeous in that bathing suit.
The last shot of the film alone is worth the admission price.
I went to the movie theater this afternoon expecting to be underwhelmed by Scoop.
Even the fluffy stuff.
This is a excellent series.
One thing they all share is they miss their mom.
And I love Michelle.
This show can relate to children and teens and.
I love the episode when I think her name is DD.
That was a great episode.
I recommend this show for everyone.
Full House is a great show.
I am still today growing up on it.
she is my favorite.
she had such a sense of humor.
it really is a good show.
i really think that this show should go down to many generations in families.
and it is great too because it is an appropriate show for all ages.
i give it 5 out of 5 stars.
It will make you feel a lot better.
you really should watch it and you will get hooked on it.
well i need must go to have some lunch.
I do not know what I would have done without Full House on television.
Both kids and adults will love this show.
The location was Sylvan Lake in the Black Hills.
So this Dakota youth looked forward to seeing the movie and was not disappointed.
The local buffalo herd was being culled so the shooting scenes were for real.
Full House came to me when I was about 9.
I think the comments regarding the show being cheesy are a bit too exaggerated.
It makes you laugh and it is not just humor.
I grew up watching Full House as a child.
Now my kids watch the show and they love to watch it as well.
It has good teachings your kids can learn from.
It talks about real life problems and family matters.
There is always a lesson you can learn from the show.
I vote the show a 10.
There is never a dull moment in Full House.
when i started high school back in 2000.
a few days after i graduated high school in 2004.
and the characters are so awesome.
Danny Tanner reminds me of my mother and grandmother.
Joey is good natured and is always in a good mood.
somehow you can actually tell that DJ is a California girl.
and Stephanie is so cool.
also i have a hard time telling the Olsen twins apart.
i want my kids to watch it one day.
i just wished they could have made a 9th season.
but season 5 and 6 i think are the best.
Full House is a great family show.
Probably the best season is the first.
Once they live there together they find they can not live without each other.
This show is about three little girls.
So the whole show is about living life.
The whole show is basically about to go with the flow.
You do not have to hold grudges you just have to let it go.
I think this show is really good and fun to watch.
I grew up watching this show and still watch it today.
I am glad they still air this show on television.
I watch it almost every day.
Who brought the cheese.
During it is run it became a phenomenon.
The Anorexic Twins became popular.
This is when life was good and simple.
This is one of the great American classics.
It was humorous and always brought home a good lesson.
This is why I dare say.
It could have gone much later than it did.
But i need those real ones to come up with another new episode.
The Show is about Danny Tanner who is guy who does news for sports.
They all live under one roof with no one to help them out.
What a little gem.
The understated cinematography is superb and terribly realistic.
Probably because those in the movie were real killing fields.
Full House was and still is a great show.
I would love to see the cast interviewed now.
This is how I feel about the show.
I started watching the show in reruns in 2001.
I enjoy the show but it had too many faults.
Actors playing different roles in different episodes.
Danny all of a sudden playing the guitar.
Only in a TV show.
I did like the D.
I have never seen a show as good as Full House.
It is a great show for anyone of any age.
The plot of the show is very believable.
Jesse is a rock star waiting to get his big break.
He looses his wife in car accident involving a drunk driver.
Playing the character of Joey was perfect for him.
She is one of the best actresses I have ever seen.
Her acting ability in Full House was very believable.
It was supposed to be where she was going to get her big break.
She showed great enthusiasm.
Most young kids can not do this.
Full House is where they got their start.
There are many more cast members that should be recognized.
I think it was to focused on her towards the end.
Especially when I think Jodie and Candice were much better at acting.
Full House is a great show for everyone.
It can teach you a lot.
Full House continues to attract new fans.
Full House has made me laugh and cry.
I have heard people say Full House is cheesy and unbelievable.
The sisters fight and get their feelings hurt.
The three men who live with the girls can get into bickers at times.
They are great actresses and seem to be very nice people.
Buster in his blissful innocence botches every act.
I used to watch this show when I was a little girl.
Two things I remember vaguely are the opening sequence and theme song.
I hope some network brings it back so I can see every episode.
This show has improved very much over the years.
Then later on though it was good but not great.
My favorite has got to be Wildcat.
Jim Cummings did a perfect job of impersonating the original voice.
And the villains were very original.
These are only a few of my favorite episodes.
When the camera moves on and away from Mr.
And director BROOKS is really a superb storyteller.
The stories are engaging and very plausible.
I can laugh myself to tears in a few choice ones.
The next day he leaves for the air circus.
The Characters have a lot of depth to them.
She can be a real hellion sometimes.
I can not get enough of this show.
One of the silliest subtitles I have seen.
This movie was beautiful.
She is not listed in the credits.
This is the most compelling and excellent performance that Robert Taylor ever gave.
Acting was very good.
Story had a unique and interesting arrangement.
The absence of violence and porno sex was refreshing.
Characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings.
I think the film is educational.
Big opportunity was missed to tell the world what they actually believe.
We may have a Mormon president some day.
I think it is definitely worth watching.
The background scenery is beautiful.
I would definitely recommend watching this movie.
We already know Joseph Smith was human.
but it takes a lot to move me to tears.
This film is a true and historical film.
It is an excellent film and I recommend it.
But most importantly it reveals the restoration of the church.
This movie was the best movie I have ever seen.
I highly recommend this movie for everyone.
This is one of the most spiritual movies I have ever seen.
I headed up with about 150 people to St.
George and we saw this movie in the visiting center of the St.
Not one person had dry eyes in the audience.
This is a movie about Joseph Smith and a great one at that.
This was a really great show.
The actors gave wonderful portrayals of the characters in the movie.
The story was accurately portrayed.
He thinks she is ridiculous for making the trip and is discouraging.
This is where the story of the Prophet Joseph Smith begins.
The way in which the story was presented was touching.
If nothing else but to gain some understanding of his life.
It will increase your testimony of this most incredible man.
This is a must see.
This is a very entertaining film and the acting was outstanding.
Good western filmed in the rocky Arizona wilds.
One really dumb scene shows Heston emptying .
Most of them seem to be inspired by Sam Peckinpah.
IMO the beginning is very good.
Maybe both had troubles with the director or were unhappy with their roles.
He is portraying the bad guy between maniac hate and cleverness.
His role and his acting is the best of the movie.
Landscapes and Shootouts are terrific.
The shootings scenes are bloody and the violence looks realistic.
Zach Provo and his gang had some gory and violent scenes.
What I miss is the typical western action in the middle of the movie.
I would have appreciated a bank robbery or something similar.
Overall it is an entertaining western flick.
I have seen this film on Sky Cinema not too long ago.
Most of the actors played it out really well.
But that how it was.
Very good to watch.
Great score from the late Jerry Goldsmith.
Wonderful piece of Western persona.
There were even buffalo killing contests.
government officers even promoted the destruction of the bison herds.
The buffalo nation was destroyed by greed and uncontrolled hunting.
He also enjoy killing Indians who steal his horses.
But Taylor steals the show.
Do he and his friends head for the Mexican border from jail and safety.
His Indian woman was killed in the hail of bullets fired.
He knows that Heston has to make it personal then.
The Last Hard Men is one nasty and brutal western.
Of which there is a lot.
It is a western that deserves nothing less.
He teaches at his school railing against human rights abuses.
Unfortunately this is also it is biggest drawback.
C efforts which forces the company to find a new identity.
It was actually believable.
I like the movie.
Melissa Joan Hart is a good actress.
Twisted Desire is my second favorite movie.
But i still love Jeremy Jordan.
Certainly worth a watch.
My only complaint is that their appeared to be no closure.
Perhaps that is part of the point.
You can see a bit of what is yet to come.
I look forward to a chance to see The Papal Chase.
v as i think she is fine.
It made me think.
Now I'm interested to find out the facts of the real case.
Little did I know.
You just do not expect this sort of role for that sort of actress.
Jessica is known to now be residing somewhere in the state of Virginia.
Melissa plays her role as the psychotic Jennifer excellently.
I love the movie.
The Woman In Black is very atmospheric and dark.
The Woman In Black is fantastic in all aspects.
This film starts off as a reasonably solid and interesting ghost story.
An hilariously accurate caricature of trying to sell a script.
But only in doses does it draw upon tag.
Whenever the camera focuses on the lady in black.
A pale look and those minor mannerisms just seem to haunt you.
This is a plain old spooky ghost story.
The ending is a real twist that caught me unawares.
Well directed and well acted.
I was so impressed I got the book by Susan Hill from Amazon.
The movie follows the book rather closely.
My copy is VHS.
I can understand why this might not appeal to all palates.
Then he brings it all to a ghastly disturbing close.
when it comes to actually scaring people.
All who love a real psychological thriller must see this movie.
it is the best of it is kind.
I'm fascinated by the fact that so many other users have said this too.
but nothing can compare to this.
Comedy Festival Aspen 1999.
Most horror movies are in fact horrible movies.
Subtlety can be more terrifying.
Most viewers would find this to be too slowly paced.
But the slow pacing helps give the story credibility.
The makeup and costume for the ghost are kept simple and believable.
Hollywood would have done an overkill and turned this idea into a mediocrity.
The woman only makes about five appearances in the film.
This is how a really great horror film should be.
and it is a terrible shame that this is out of print.
This film gave me nightmares for months and I'm 17.
You will not forget her once you have seen her.
I first saw this movie here in the U.
in December 1989 when Central TV broadcast it.
The many casual appearances of the ghost really freaked me out.
This is all in the very beginning.
One is eager to learn the meaning of it all.
The Woman In Black is a great TV movie and a lost gem.
This film is the most profoundly terrifying film I have seen.
The story is very interesting and gets your attention since the first minutes.
This one qualifies on all counts.
I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films.
This film has been scaring me since the first day I saw it.
The action keeps the viewer deeply involved and the finale is quite disturbing.
The acting is excellent and the tension is almost unbearable at times.
10 out of 10.
Other players are adequate if not quite as arresting as Emil and Russell are.
Who actually wants to discuss the theories of Relativity.
The vintage costumes and locations of the period all come off fittingly enough.
But I think it is excellent.
Each of them contains the seeds of their own destruction.
Enter Senator McCarthy who thinks Einstein is a Red.
It is a powerful and memorable moment.
Insignificance is one of my top five movies of all time.
It is utterly amazing.
A lovely little B picture with all the usual Joe Lewis touches.
people ripping up pillows and auras of lurking fear.
This is surely his best.
It does not lack crime.
The title character answers an ad.
She is overjoyed that she will be making some money as a secretary.
Only a very strong person could survive such a terrifyingly unsettling ordeal.
And Nina Foch gives the sense of a strong woman as Julia.
Foch has an elegant manner.
Surely the single most fascinating element is the casting of Dame May Witty.
But here she is far from a heroine.
It seems that this famous and brilliant movie was made almost by accident.
Undoubtedly the director knew exactly what he was doing.
But he did it on a low budget.
She became one of the great acting teachers in Los Angeles.
Julia answers an ad for a secretary and is hired immediately by Mrs.
Hughes and her son Ralph.
Hughes and not allowed to leave.
The acting is very good.
Julia obtains the position and is hired by a Mrs.
Hughes and has some very strange desires for playing around with knives.
MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS is a mesmerizing 1945 B thriller from Joseph H.
And very modest resources.
Her predicament makes no sense.
Lewis took a big step toward cult status with this film and understandably so.
Just dark enough to be interesting and light enough to be enjoyed by everyone.
I have downloaded the entire soundtrack at one point or another.
This a real diamond in the rough and not to be missed.
Strongly recommended for all ages from 9 year olds to grannies.
Lovely period piece capturing 1962.
she loves to get the kids and her into silly and sometimes dangerous games.
It is just that good.
This show is just good clean television.
The comparisons to the HAUNTING are superficial.
This was that movie for me.
They just do not make spook films like this one anymore.
and a wickedly ironic ending.
Scared the hell out of me.
Everyone that has spent the night there previously has died.
Steele makes most any film worth seeing.
The story concerns a haunted castle.
The only flaw I see in the movie is the running time.
It almost feels padded.
There is a large portion of the first act where literally nothing happens.
Our hero stumbles around in the dark finding nothing of interest.
I found the movie genuinely creepy and at the same time sorrowful.
Babs Steele is undeniably beautiful.
The music score makes the atmosphere twice as terror inducing.
This film is quite suitable for a rainy day or evening.
the Night of the Dead.
It was the first on the bill.
The film is not without faults.
Clearly some effort was put into its restoration and deservedly so.
This movie does contradict the first.
I will not deny that.
That indecipherable quality tantalizes me into watching it again and again.
The problem with the movie is in its structure.
The compositions are stunning.
You should see it at least once.
See it for yourself to find out the rest of the story.
This film gets very high marks for creating a creepy atmosphere.
The scene where Dr.
I would not hesitate to recommend this film to horror movie lovers.
This begins a wager between Edgar Allen Poe and a journalist.
Overall this is pretty good and in gloomy black and white.
Barbara Steele definitely makes the movie too.
8 out of 10.
Her mere presence turns a creepy ghost story into something truly memorable.
Well executed old and very dark house horror.
Plus we have the delightful and enigmatic Barbara Steele.
The crypt sequence is really eerie and the tension is almost unbearable.
Then the other actors respond in English to what was being said.
The series is lovable because of these puns.
You will be laughing at their own view of heaven.
I would definitely suggest this one for younger children.
There is a totally different side to the Japanese animation.
Even the theme song alone is funny.
You will laugh until your sides hurt.
Another comment about this film made it sound lousy.
Davis was so young and fresh.
She had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect.
My vote is see it and remember how young this type of film was.
The acting is indeed fine in most every respect.
Condensing the gigantic W.
Davis is intense to the point of scary.
But Ms Davis films of 1934 tell quite the opposite.
But even that is not all.
And it was the latter role that launched her among the greatest stars.
The story is simply too big to be told in mere 83 minutes.
Camera movements between the some scenes is also original and refreshing.
Which he just refuses to hear.
The movie may be great.
I do not make this claim lightly.
You just want to shake him.
Her Nora was the woman Philip should have stayed with.
Her Sally did not push her talent to the limits.
The film seems rather dated now in 2003.
It was startling for me to see how young Ms.
Davis looks in this move.
I felt slightly indifferent and detached about the movie after viewing it.
A classic that deserves it reputation.
It gave me the chills for some reason.
Leslie Howard was gorgeous.
He did a great job.
So I bought it.
It was impossible to take her character seriously.
In the other major role was Leslie Howard and he did it superbly.
He was a subtle and intelligent actor The supporting actors acquit themselves well.
And the ending is a real tearjerker.
Of Human Bondage is a fascinating piece of cinema despite its superficial faults.
It also has to be viewed in perspective.
A fine example of his skillful direction is the scene set at Victoria Station.
Davis rose the stardom with her performance.
The motion picture will like to classic cinema buffs.
Thanks to her performance she brings this rather dull movie to life.
This movie is about sexual obsession.
Bette Davis plays Mildred.
This is a woman who men are drawn to.
Now the movie does not come out and say that but it is obvious.
He starts buying her things even pays for her apartment.
Meanwhile she is seeing other people and she makes no secrets of it.
He is constantly thinking about her.
His med school grades are even failing.
He is heart broken but he meets another woman.
They seem fine but it is obvious he is still dreaming of the Bimbo.
Mildred does comes back with a baby and unwed.
Finally Sally and her dad takes him in.
Not before another March of Time montage showing him going downhill.
Meanwhile he finds Mildred needs him again.
I wished she told him to stuff it.
But I feel Phillip was the bad guy.
But in any case he dogs those women waiting for Mildred.
Yes she was not a respectable woman but far from a villain.
Mitchell or Professor Henry Higgins is not one who is betrayed.
He is sensitive for several reasons.
And she finds him an easy meal ticket.
But the performance of Davis as Mildred makes the film important.
Curiously her performance was not all of one note.
Every motion picture Bette Davis stars in is worth experiencing.
Few became great actors.
Her body was so curvy when she was young.
Several features of this film immediately date it.
It is probably construed to send you home with a smile on your face.
Watching her performance is still spellbinding.
She makes the viewer absolutely despise her and pity her at the same time.
I will not deny that.
So this movie was also good for my imagination.
And it is also got great emotional depth to it too.
I used to watch it at least once a week.
Now it is just too bad that they never made a soundtrack available.
Out on the streets with nowhere to go Philip is taken in by Mr.
Of the three remakes on W.
The film is dominated by Mildred from the start.
Bette Davis gives a fantastic portrayal of Mildred.
This was one of her best roles and she ran away with it.
Her disgust toward the kind Philip is clear from the onset of their relationship.
Leslie Howard underplayed Philip and makes him appear even weaker than he is.
All much in the style back then.
The choreography is awesome and the storyline is basic.
but this time around it is lighter and more comedic.
I saw this movie once on late night t.
and knew it was the best movie ever.
The progression of the main character is seamless.
Act One sets up the premise.
Act Two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob.
Act Three is where the fight fest begins.
Than they work to together to save the Care Bears.
This is simply the epitome of what a made for TV movie should be.
The poorly written script.
It has it all.
Everyone involved in its creation deserves a medal.
all of 27 when she made this movie.
But this one is just plain crazy.
Life appears very good.
Both are great fun.
They start a dance school that is soon very successful.
You do not want to mess with her.
This is my favorite of the three care bears movies.
Once again I liked all the songs.
And of course I LOVED the songs.
My favorites being Growing Up and Forever Young.
The care bears movies have always had such good songs.
Ten stars for a very good movie.
The atmosphere is a fine mix of comic and eerie.
Lots of lovely swipes at Hollywood and the terrifying movie tot.
See it and love it.
But still this movie is highly entertaining.
The two stars and Curtis Harrington stylish direction easily overcomes its flaws.
A very strange and compelling movie.
One of the more memorable films I have seen in a long while.
Fantastic performances all around.
I saw it at the Silent Movie Theater here in LA.
My vote is seven.
I always sat down and watched the first one.
As I got older I learned to prefer this one.
I tend to annoy everyone by singing it.
It was really surprising.
I think it is a wonderful movie.
It leaves an effect on you.
Again this movie can teach everyone at all ages about morality.
Romantic comedies are tough movies.
The cast is talented.
And he never looks comfortable in these dopey roles.
But I still miss his work in independent films.
Perhaps the problem lies in the script more than anything else.
This was actually a fun movie.
Jason Lee is good in everything he does.
Selma Blair needs to eat something.
But she still looks beautiful.
Maybe that is one source of disappointment.
I got to say this is one of his good leading roles.
However I do believe his role in Vanilla Sky was better acted.
This movie is all right.
She chooses his clothes and his daily schedule.
And suddenly she turns up everywhere.
It is not only about saving his wedding.
it is about survival.
And he got nice support from beautiful ladies Julia Stiles and Selma Blair.
I enjoyed it very much.
I happened to watch this movie by chance some days ago while flipping channels.
My expectations were not very high but it was an interesting movie.
The movie contains the right mix of comedy and romance.
Definitely worth a watch.
I was worried that my daughter might get the wrong idea.
You can also feel their chemistry between them.
This made the already muddled mystery story even more difficult to keep track of.
The ending at the carnival reminds one of David Lynch almost.
The acting here is also very good.
well it becomes murder mystery of plotted devilment and much shenanigans.
He was and remains a unique force in film.
One can consider whether in an earlier age he would have been a painter.
This film certainly reinforces that impression.
I like the accent.
I love all of his movies and wish there were more.
I particularly love how other actors interacted with him on film.
Watch it and be grateful for the chance.
But I find the story excellent too.
This film is brilliant.
It alone is worth the cost of a rental.
Even the great Mr.
But the credit went to Stevenson.
For five years in Hollywood it was barely a great record.
So the marriage was going on the rocks as well.
It was a wise question.
Certainly it has a curious plot development.
She convinces him to hire Michael as the skipper of their yacht.
Glenn Anders was a leading Broadway performer.
Surely that must count for something.
Pure Orson Welles genius makes this one of the greatest of movies.
That scene alone is worth the price of admission.
No one should miss this picture.
Plenty of eye candy here.
Welles handles that combination of material skillfully as a director.
Welles blocks scenes with skill.
Instead he relies on externals such as accents and fake noses.
What a sad life for such a vibrant beauty.
That he presented himself as a rootless sailor is telling.
This movie is like shrimp in garlic and lemon.
Great camera works and lighting techniques.
He was playing by different rules.
He is also wonderful in a Touch Of Evil.
it is really ignorant.
His direction defines what great direction is.
Check out the courtroom scene.
Usually they are such stock scenes that I can not stand them.
Watch that juror who is always sneezing and interrupting the proceedings.
Or just take a look at the lighting in that scene.
But things do not go to plan.
One wonders why he hires Michael.
She was a brilliant actress when given the chance to show off her talent.
45 bullet through her head.
Several characters as suspects in the mystery.
Instead it was a matter of deliberate caprice by the gods for amusement.
The investment in environment beyond all.
The second Care Bears movie is immensely better than its predecessor.
Critics need to review what they class as a quality movie.
Gotten better with age so to speak.
So far this film is starting to sound a lot like Gilda.
One can only imagine the film Mr.
Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders made an excellent contribution to the movie.
They pop up all over.
I am convinced that this would have been an excellent cut.
Any or all of these items might have inspired the music.
There is no sound atmosphere on the boat.
A little wind and water is sorely missed.
At the start of the picnic sequence.
The Hawaiian guitar music which comes out of the radio.
was supposed to be corny enough to make a certain satirical point.
Nobody in the audience could possibly suspect that we are kidding.
The aquarium scene needs more echo.
The gun battle with the breaking mirrors must not be backed with music.
If you saw the original film you will notice a discrepancy.
The babies are adorable and it is fun watching them play and grow.
The songs are sweet and memorable.
I could not believe how freaking amazing this film was.
It is by far one of the best independent films I have ever seen.
I would recommend it to anyone who loves movies.
In addition the digital photography is the best of the lot so far.
I loved this movie from the opening sequence right through to the end.
I look forward to more offerings from this creative and talented director.
oh lord I hope he gets better and makes plenty of other movies.
the guy knows how to handle a sword and to pull an entertaining massacre.
he is the total package.
it is pretty amazing.
it is pretty straightforward.
Japan is in serious trouble.
My Rating 7 out of 10.
These are the basic premises.
The story begins with a festival in a local town.
From here the story gets interesting.
I was however mistaken in the best possible way.
It becomes a practically theatrical experience which takes your breath away.
Its a horror style play thats been filmed.
It is all in all a solidly great film.
I might just watch it again myself.
An ending which is guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat.
This is a nice piece of work.
Very sexy and engaging enough plot to keep my interest throughout.
and that was funny when she sprayed him in the eye in the store.
sometimes these movies make me mad when people act stupid and do stupid things.
but that is what i think an thought about the movie.
Many suspects in this one.
I have not seen any other movie quite like True Crime.
i mean it is exciting.
I would recommend it to other people.
It comes on Lifetime movie network quite a lot.
I really like her as an actress and person.
She seems so nice and down to earth.
Kevin just seems too sweet for me.
But I think he did okay.
just like she is in real life.
In fact everyone in the cast does a good job .
I reckon her characterization of MG has some mileage in it too.
I can only wonder what happened after such a promising start.
I think it is an entertaining story worth seeing.
While in space he contracted some bizarre and unknown disease.
Just gotta love it for what it is.
It starts off slow and you wonder if there is anything going to happen.
It chills you right to the bone.
Never the less a great ending that begs you to want to know more.
Loved it and well done and thanks for the ride.
never comprehending the race had LONG GONE BY.
but how come he.
The melting guy wanders around killing people.
A very special movie.
The character of Dr.
That sequence with the nurse is simply hilarious.
The climax is especially fun.
Hollywood needs to consider a charming remake of this movie.
My wife and I would go see it.
This movie has Tony Randall at his best.
Too bad Hollywood does not make movies like this anymore.
Most people will never have any use for these.
He sends Tony Randall to check out the situation.
They make a cute couple actually.
I think most would agree that from documentaries we expect enlightenment and authenticity.
eventually after about a week of looking i found it on atom films.
I started off fine.
at the end i pushed back my chair and stood up.
even after the fourth or fifth time its still unsettling.
But the film gets high marks for a fun script and decent acting.
Many critics have felt offended that R.
They are mutually related.
They are both good in different ways.
she was more believably sweet and sentimental.
This is the best Emma in existence in my opinion.
The 1996 movie with G.
Both versions are very good but I prefer this one.
i really loved this version of Emma the best.
the only complaint that i had was on Mr.
she was a smart girl in the end though.
I have lost count of the number of versions going around.
Mark Strong did a fabulous job.
Emma must show that she accepts this now.
She is a changed woman.
I will buy into it.
just as I would have imagined her.
I believe that when the UK does a Jane Austen its the best.
American versions of English literature are done for money and not for quality.
I was always borderline with the other Emma.
It seems put on.
Sorry but do not think Toni and Gwenneth did a brilliant job there.
It is definitely the version I will come back to from now on.
I also love the new scene at the end.
The setting and costumes were beautiful.
She is snobbish but has just enough youth and inexperience to be still likable.
A strange departure from the faithfulness otherwise shown throughout the film.
For me this production was and remains a delight.
The film also marks the beginning of the series featuring the Hardy family.
Lionel Barrymore plays Judge Hardy with conviction.
He is the glue that holds everything together.
This is a excellent start to the film career of Mickey Rooney.
His talents here shows that a long career is ahead for him.
The car and truck chase is exciting for the 1937 era.
This start of the Andy Hardy series is an American treasure in my book.
I think it would be a winner.
Her name is Fanny and she is interviewed here.
The film makers make the film more than just another documentary.
Recently more and more documentaries have been making it to cinemas.
But this one as to be amongst the best.
I used to borrow the books from the school library every chance I got.
Seven young people go to the forest looking for a bear.
Soon they are all stalked and viciously murdered by a crazy Vietnam veteran.
However if you are a fan of slasher movies give this rarity a look.
My brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie.
So there must be something.
10 out of 10.
The forestry setting and particularly the camouflaged booby traps are joyously spectacular.
The film launches in the somewhat unfamiliar territory of a pistol duel.
All this talk about this being a bad movie is nonsense.
As a matter of fact this is the best movie I have ever seen.
I would not give criticism to any of the actors.
That movie is the best and it will always stay that way.
Full of profound emotions from every angle.
Irons deserved an award for his performance and Close was never better.
And this something was the most important part.
i would give each actor an Oscar.
i wish the movie received more awards.
the story was beautiful and sad at the same time.
He makes so many mistakes but gets a chance for redemption.
Many people here utterly dislike this movie.
I can not understand that one single bit.
This movie is an incredible piece of work.
Stellar performances all around.
This one had me weeping for about half an hour straight.
Spend some real time with this one.
Esteban is find enough.
The way the plot was constructed with the ending mirroring the beginning was great.
What is told is told fairly well.
The acting is excellent.
The film is based entirely on a pair of hapless lovers.
Beautifully filmed and acted.
Reveals an area of Paris which is alive and filled with comedy and tragedy.
This movie is dear to the French movies buffs for another very special reason.
What saves this plot is its connection with the story of M.
She does not appear to cause such a curiosity while talking.
Garbo was very good in American film and she is also very good here.
Even William Daniels cinematography seems improved over his filming of the Brown version.
This version of Anna Christie is in German.
Both were filmed back to back because Garbo had such a following in Germany.
Garbo herself supposedly favored her Anna Christie in this version over the English version.
this is a great movie.
then you see him chanting poems as he ran to escape the wolves.
So the main theme is the guy trying to save the beautiful ghost.
And I'm looking forward to watching the first sequel of this movie also.
If there is a movie to be called perfect then this is it.
Go find it somewhere.
This is one of the reasons people rave about Hong Kong cinema.
Entertainment at it is peak.
Just read the original story which is written by Pu in 18th century.
The result is pure beauty.
The film has some wonderful visuals and amazing fights.
I love especially the fight scene between Wu Ma and the tree demon tongue.
Not to repeat other reviews here.
The score is very good and moving.
Recommend everybody to see it.
The filmmakers have crafted a movie that appeals to every horror fan.
The story is engrossing and original.
The villains are appropriately menacing and frightening.
The sets are creepy and atmospheric.
This film easily fits into many different categories.
This film offers something for every film fan.
Her portrayal of the title character is truly haunting and memorable.
Wu Ma is hilarious as the cantankerous Taoist who aids the young lovers.
The direction is superb.
The cinematography is gorgeous.
Enough good things can not be said about this film.
Find a copy anywhere you can.
The art set decoration and other aesthetic facets are all mesmerizing.
More fantastically the movie had a total black humorous undertone in it.
The climax is like a mirror of Miranda Otto fighting with the Ring Witch.
I like the good and evil battle.
I liked Eddie in this movie better than any movie he has ever done.
He shows heart and a more humble humor.
A beautiful story that truly pays attention to details.
I saw this movie in my childhood.
My all times favorite movie.
I follow this movie.
The story about the power of love is pretty touching and warm.
A beautiful story that truly pays attention to details.
Some of the special effects may seem outdated compared to modern standards.
This minor flaw is easily ignored.
There is so much to discover in this story.
The romantic relation between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts.
The visuals are beautiful too.
This movie is incredible.
The final showdown is specially breathtaking and the music score is kinda cool.
Not for the smallest children though.
This one deserves a 10.
My pal Steve Parkhouse recorded it on VHS and sent it to me.
The crew of cinematographers have also done miracles.
This is a film where every shot is an expertly crafted painting.
From the opening song onwards the music becomes as important as the characters.
The score is a perfect mixture of modern and traditional instruments.
And we of course have the acting talent.
She is the epitome of ethereal beauty.
But later it is shown in all its crazy glory.
A true team effort that has given us a truly ground breaking movie.
that should tell you something.
I saw when I was a child and I have a good memory.
I think the end is very worth sticking around.
She targets him and decides he will do nicely.
He is all too eager to be eaten up by the young beauty.
Hysteria and fear take over from cool calculation and cunning.
It appears to be England.
Corny plot and in many cases terrible acting.
Yet the movie is so juicy and so suspenseful.
More faithful to the book than most movies of its era.
Joan Fontaine stars as the villain in this Victorian era film.
Marshall is quite good as Miles.
It takes an actress with extraordinary talent to pull that off.
I highly recommend this film.
I watched this film and then Jane Eyre right after.
she just keeps getting better.
My heart was racing.
Great old movie drama.
Just what i want from a classic movie.
Facial expressions are worth the whole film.
I'm glad i have it on video.
The costumes are very nice.
Whenever they try they just seem to make a cheesy movie.
Films in black and white still hold a certain mystery.
A strange role for Eddie Murphy to take at the height of his career.
The sets look phony.
So we have here a flawed but very interesting version.
The Sea is Watching was an interesting film experience.
It was obvious what we were to look at in each frame.
The physicality of the set itself contributed to that feeling of smallness and intensity.
Maybe we just miss the eye of the master.
To expect that might well be very silly.
This is a very fine and poetic story.
It goes deep into your feelings without becoming melodramatic.
This should help clear up some details which may be confusing to the unaware.
You will not be disappointed.
I recommend this film to all that love a epic period piece.
They are not accurate on this film.
Eddie Murphy really shines in his roll.
You can sit down with your whole family and everybody will enjoy it.
I recommend this movie to everybody to see.
It is a comedy with a touch of fantasy.
This movie takes you from L.
lowest of the low.
The movie deserves a higher rating.
It is a tale of survival of women in feudal Japan.
the strong ones while women were thought to be just mindless and weak property.
Each has a reason for turning to the life of geisha.
The sea is watching and will find protection for true love.
My boyfriend and I both enjoyed this film very much.
A tragically wonderful movie.
brings us to a Japan that does not exist anymore.
The characters are full of depth and act with much intensity.
I can understand those who dislike this movie cause of a lack of knowledge.
I did greatly enjoy the art direction and the acting.
The film was full of beautiful touches.
the courtroom scene itself.
with the couple copulating in the cage while the heroine pleads for their orgasm.
I have not seen this movie in 20 years.
but it made indelible pictures in my mind.
especially when you are 17 and have a constant hard on.
This movie was good for it is time.
This was one of her first movies and she was not bad.
I loved the the film.
Out with the old and in with the new.
She brings to mind a New Yorker cartoon of a few years ago.
They have to carry it and they do.
I found the film compelling.
She is realistic settings and atmospheres.
As usual it was inevitable the usual negative comments.
Before you read the review already knew what was the final judgment.
In the film a good gift because 10 is really well done.
then comes the noises and the loud pounding from the apartment upstairs at night.
And the sinister new neighbors soon become more than a little bothersome to Alice.
The flashback scenes are what really made it for me.
The ending I consider to be one of the finest in Horror history.
The Sentinel has the perfect build up of tension.
We are never fully comfortable whenever Allison is on screen.
It will give you the thrills and scares you need to be satisfied.
Well worth the look.
Time has not been kind to this movie.
This falls on her in atonement for her attempted suicide earlier in her life.
The cast was competent.
The damned souls at the end are portrayed by actual sideshow freaks and geeks.
Whoever thought to do that was a twisted but brilliant genius.
It remains a strangely compelling and entertaining dip into the realm of evil.
the Brooklyn Queens Expressway.
This happens to be one of my favorite horror films.
Burgess Meredith is delightful as the lovably insane neighbor.
There is almost no gore.
The direction is quite spartan.
but perhaps I have said too much already.
I highly recommend you not watch it alone.
Whoever was the casting director for this film deserves some sort of prize.
8 out of 10.
The end scene is repulsive and yet chilling.
Unfortunately there are no extras beyond a trailer that looks pretty worse for wear.
Alison Parker is a model with some fame.
Alison realizes that she is living in the gateway to hell.
Yesterday I saw this movie once more.
The creepy and lurid story frightens even in the present days.
The cast is a constellation of stars and starlets.
My vote is nine.
The first time you see The Second Renaissance it may look boring.
Look at it at least twice and definitely watch part 2.
It will change your view of the matrix.
and thus the populace has become lazy and derogatory towards them.
I would say it does a great job of that.
The plot is good.
Thus it holds clips from fictional news reports and the like.
Japan makes some of the best animation in the world.
Sadly most of these shorts are disappointing.
The Second Renaissance is made as a historical file.
It tells how humans made machines in their own likeness.
The machine does not have a fair trial and riots start around the world.
The governments of the world order to dismantle machines.
The short also has some religious themes and religious iconography.
Seeing themselves as the rightful masters of the machines.
He is willing to use violence and know how to keep a story going.
But its a good watch.
Plus it needs to be seen with part two to be complete.
This is the perfect method to reveal the history.
It was a lot of fun working for and with R.
Harlin and wished I had a chance to do it again.
Or at least that is what you would have thought.
I give it 3.
A very entertaining horror film with some very nice touches indeed.
The film is not exactly original but the plot line is interesting.
We focus on a prison that has been reopened after a number of years.
It looks creepy as all empty and filled with prisoners.
We are given some character depth and several of the prisoners are interesting characters.
Chelsea Field is okay as the female lead.
But these scenes are visually creative and interesting.
The acting is uniformly decent.
The script actually much more cohesive than one usually gets from films like these.
It seems that the time for vengeance has finally arrived.
even though these are genuinely unsettling as well.
Lane Smith is deliciously wicked as the guilty warden.
This atmospheric and very moody film features lots of gruesome gore and violence.
I was amused throughout and laughed out loud plenty of times.
And made tonnes more money.
Time to end this review.
I love this movie like no other.
The movie captivates your attention for every second.
This movie really kicked some ass.
I watched it over and over and it never got boring.
This movie lived up to what I had hoped for.
Like I said its a hidden surprise.
It well written well acted and well cast.
I liked everything in this movie.
Look its Hollywood all right but the brighter side.
Well worth a look.
And it is a role he plays well.
Timothy Hutton plays a fine villain and Angelina Jolie pouts.
Drug addiction and a desire for the sultry Jolie mix a heady cocktail.
This film has a lot of raw potential.
In the end he just tries too hard.
Angelina Jolie was also really good.
I enjoyed this movie.
Very unfair to say the least.
By sheer accident he becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire Raymond Blossom.
However the FBI take an interest in using Eugene to snare Blossom.
She puts in a solid performance.
Timothy Hutton playing Blossom is superb and immersed himself deeply into his character.
I love this film.
It is well written and acted and has good cinematography.
Great cast all together.
A must see for people bored with the same old action movie.
I gave it 8 stars.
For a first film in a proposed series it achieves the right balance.
I'm looking forward to the next film.
This is what I do with books that I like as well.
What I got was a movie not based on action or violence.
The director had focused on history and psychology.
almost boring and unreal.
The acting could have been improved too.
And please forgive me for my bad English.
For me they were totally credible.
When looking at it again I must say it is actually pretty OK.
The script and direction provide some gems.
The first point I like to make is that this is slightly wrongfully classified.
It is one of the greatest adventure comic strips of all time.
I enjoyed this film.
However this is acceptable just to get such a faithful version.
Positive surprised of this story about Modesty and her childhood.
So I may have overrate this movie just a little.
I have seen this movie and I must say I'm very impressed.
I fancy to see this again.
Action fused with a fantastic story.
The bad boy is pretty too.
The movie does not introduce Willie Garvin or Sir Gerald.
What this movie accomplishes is showing the strength of the character by herself.
The film does not come across as cheap.
I first saw this movie on television some years ago and frankly loved it.
Charles Dance makes one of the most terrifying villains anyone can imagine.
His sophistication is such a perfect contrast to the crudely good hero.
I loved it when I first saw it and I love it still.
I suspect it might not do that well in the USA in general distribution.
She has lots of closeups.
What we have here is a step or two better than that.
I just hope they do better on that if and when they make sequels.
I used to watch this show when I was a little girl.
I vaguely remember the theme song.
No such scenes are present or needed.
Short synopsis This film opens with soldiers being released from the company of men.
One of them pursues another with a weird scheme the other repeatedly refuses.
It is also very stylish.
The wardrobe is also very good.
Both do a considerable amount of acrobatics.
And it is certainly the man himself we hear.
He is the best brainy police inspector I know.
No such scenes are present or needed.
Michael Ritchie and Eddie Murphy fit the bill for this capacity just fine.
My advice to you is to buy the ticket and take the ride.
Losing Algiers was a bitter blow.
I definitely recommend reading the book prior to watching the film.
Having grown up in Melbourne I could really relate to this book and movie.
Those that rent the movie based on this description will only be disappointed.
This is what I like about it.
But the glamorous and sultry Ms.
For the first half of the movie the little girl grated on my nerves.
I do not think this is one of her best acting jobs.
The story is based on true events and that helps the movie.
It is a great movie.
i just saw this movie on TV.
i can feel the lost that the little girl Desi felt.
the feeling of wanting to see her father again.
wanting to talk to him.
or at least given the chance to say goodbye.
it just lets me feel that miracles do exist.
There is an intense scene or two in this.
I recommend this to fans of these types of movies.
The little girl Desi is so adorable.
I cant think of a more beautiful story then this one here.
Great cast and an overall great movie.
with a little help of it is friends.
It has a great cast.
My family and I have viewed this movie often over the years.
There are no downsides to this sweet human story.
What a lovely heart warming television movie.
Her mother is also very distressed .
only a miracle can alleviate their unhappiness.
The film is based on a true story which makes it so touching.
James Robson Glasgow Scotland U.
This is a great movie.
It is based on a true story.
I loved this movie.
This was one of the most popular with all our customers.
i can see why they have 3 nominations.
you can find mermaid at all blockbuster video stores.
This is the way a proper horror movie should be.
I think the reason it was so scary was because it was so realistic.
The spooky sounding score was perfect for setting a dark mood.
The special effects were very good.
I would love to see more horror movies like this one.
Other then that it had all the elements a good horror movie needs.
I will be adding it to my collection.
It will keep you completely off balance.
I screamed out loud two or three times during the show.
