Or maybe this film will inspire you to help others.
The take on lawyers is also superb.
His character is more malevolent than usual.
This is easily the most underrated film inn the Brooks cannon.
Many of the jokes fall flat.
This is not the typical Mel Brooks film.
It rates a 7.
Yes its an art.
to successfully make a slow paced thriller.
The story unfolds in nice volumes while you do not even notice it happening.
Fine performance by Robin Williams.
The direction is good.
Use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and unexpectedness is good.
Williams returns to New York.
A scene or two establishing their relationship might have helped set the stage.
She is that good.
I liked the film.
I especially liked the opening scene which had a semi truck in it.
A very tense action scene that seemed well done.
Also the film is funny is several parts.
I also liked how the evil guy was portrayed too.
I would give the film an 8 out of 10.
I enjoyed The Night Listener very much.
Robin Williams gives one of his best performances.
Sandra Oh adds a wonderful comic touch.
Everyone is very believable.
I wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the movie.
Do not be sucker punched by the previews and ads.
See The Night Listener because you want to see a good story told well.
If you go expecting Hitchcock you will be disappointed.
My only complaint with the movie was the ending.
I can guarantee you that you have never seen this kind of movie before.
This is no americanized movie.
Neither is it a predictable movie.
I just kept waiting for it to get better.
Something that makes you jump off your seat.
I will leave it at that.
Toni Collette also stars.
The production felt rushed and holes are apparent.
It certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort.
The book is probably better.
I found that there were so many perfect choices made.
and for the last number of years.
This Night Listener is better than people are generally saying.
Give it a shot.
This is the token moody period Gothic horror entry from the bunch.
A real campy hoot.
Watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room.
An act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced.
This has got to be a unique twists of two genres of ever seen.
The giant monster movie genre with the living mummy movie genre.
This unique blend makes for a unique and compelling story.
The acting was wonderful.
I give THE FALLEN ONES 9 OUT OF 10.
It looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance.
The charismatic Miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable.
I am sure this movie will always be in my top 5.
The acting is superb.
I do not think anyone could have a better job than Kate.
Titanic is the greatest movie of the 21st Century.
There is nothing wrong with this movie.
Apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time.
The script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard.
It just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key moments.
95 would be an acceptable price for the film.
Which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it.
Not that Titanic has none of that.
But the reason Titanic works is that it is such an emotional ride.
And look at the top ten grossing films of all time.
And this movie made 1.
8 BILLION DOLLARS worldwide.
It can not be bad.
no one will remember it in 50 years.
It was so touching and beautiful.
I strongly recommend seeing for all.
Could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece.
It will be almost impossible.
The director no doubt had the major impact on the film.
The movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling.
Everything looks very real and live.
The acting was the real effect.
No one could have done better.
They are partly the reason why the film is so great.
I guess it is not too much to talk about.
I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving.
It was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever.
In the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears.
The story is simple and it works.
She calls and tells her tale on the RMS Titanic.
Everything about the story works and there are very few flaws.
Rose almost commits suicide but the Gilbert Grape star rescues her.
I really liked the hanging over the boat scene.
It was a good risk.
However I think it is unfair to say that they are terrible actors.
Titanic is a classic.
When the movie came out people flocked to the theaters.
It was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason.
They trusted each other.
They sure as hell are giving Romeo and Juliet a run for their money.
It really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie.
For me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time.
He sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film.
But Titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance.
The music has become iconic and legendary.
My heart will not go on from this one.
Jack and Rose return to the top deck.
Leonardo DiCaprio is terrific on screen with big charisma.
He keeps a 56 carat blue diamond worn by Louis XVI.
The decor is overwhelming.
One for the ages.
Everything of the time was very formal.
Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes.
Technically the film is very well done.
PEOPLE make the film a huge success.
I avoided watching this film for the longest time.
One of the girls spoke about this movie.
I shared my feelings with my fellow judges.
The movie must have done something right to get her so interested.
Then it finally appeared on Pay TV.
My high school public speaking contestant was right.
The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world.
This is truly an excellent movie.
It is the most amazing love story ever attempted.
I will gladly side with the majority this time around.
And they are too embarrassed now to admit it.
in all the same places.
You look like an out of touch cynic.
No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults.
Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation.
James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic.
How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me.
I was utterly transfixed.
This film is one memorable scene after another.
Titanic leaving port in Southampton.
The screams of the doomed after she went down.
And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears.
And the love theme was beautiful and tragic.
The film was made with such humanity.
This is a movie teenagers should watch.
Maybe that way they will start appreciating the value of family again.
He should be offered more serious roles.
This movie can be appreciated by people of all ages.
Because it portrays the values that are important in life.
It just may be haunted.
A crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film.
The tracking and the cuts need to be slow.
The performances help create tension.
But neither menace is really the point.
The point is human relationships.
There are a number of character arcs that are very interesting.
How disappointing to have it end.
Every character was important and did a fabulous job carrying their role.
I would have loved to see each character develop over the years.
Yes it touched my heart.
Family problems abound in real life and that is what this movie is about.
ALL the actors portraying their characters did outstanding performances.
A must see for those who care about their families.
The cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years.
Anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much.
I think this movie was way ahead of its time.
I have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here.
This is a film.
Fine acting and directing.
Watching this film made me remember my first love.
Highly recommended for all film lovers.
I plan on trying to get a copy of it myself to watch.
The story is very touching and I would recommend it to anyone.
This is a movie for the whole family despite its rating.
This is a movie I will show to my children.
She was such a great actor for being so little.
but she really seemed to be in character perfectly.
which is just so heartwarming after all the mishaps in the movie.
The two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context.
This movie is the best film ever.
Little girl liked to be his granddaughter and King of Masks liked a grandson.
They were not conventional in real.
Every scene they were together was priceless.
The camera work is flawless and grips you.
The acting is inspired.
He played his helpful and kindhearted character extremely well.
I can not recommend this film enough.
The whole film is in loops.
Everything has a significance.
It just keeps changing its mood like its protagonist changes his face.
Last scene on the rope is phenomenal.
Story and script is flawless.
Both the protagonists are artists you can tell the way they have performed.
It was not even nominated for Oscars.
The young girl is an amazing talent.
The original Chinese dialog heightens the emotional intensity of the performances and the story.
What a wonderful film.
The acting is sublime.
The filming is pleasant and the environment is keenly realistic.
It seemed worthwhile to experience.
Acting is solid enough.
Thematically puerile but still rich enough to compliment the vehicle of its expression.
The story is absorbing.
The setting is serene and the costuming simple.
But do not get me started on that.
This movie was excellent.
A sad truth to how culture tends to clash with the sexes.
This is just one big warm fuzzy type of movie.
This equals on big happy movie in the end.
Bound to be in Oscar contention for best foreign film.
A welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies.
And I think they did pretty well with this.
There are many stories inside this one.
An unexpected pleasure as I had heard nothing about this film.
Shameful since it warrants having a wider audience.
Solidly acted by the principals.
Master Wang is sold a son by a slave trader.
All is well as he joyfully prepares to pass down his art.
But the son eventually is found out to be a girl.
This is a wonderful film for children as well as adults.
Beautiful and touching movie.
I never saw such an interesting setting when I was in China.
This is probably my favorite movie of all time.
It is perfection in its storytelling.
Street entertainer catching the attention of famous opera star and friendship ensuing.
I was happy to see the Shaw Brothers are still producing good films.
The story is simple.
The faces of the actors are marvelous to see.
A round device that creates a wormhole.
It gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds.
I find that great.
Blockbuster has it rated as though it were an X rated movie.
This deserves a lot better treatment.
and the problems that ensue afterward.
The rest of the story is how the two manage after that.
This spectacular film is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen.
I simply can not recommend this movie highly enough.
It may just change you forever once you have seen it.
It shows Taylor at the height of her beauty.
Thank goodness Dana Andrews is around to save the day.
One of my favorite guilty pleasures.
Atlantis is still going strong on its 4th seasons.
Such craftsmanship reveals the careful attention to detail that these men sought.
My parents took me to this movie when I was nine years old.
I have never forgotten it.
I had never before seen anything as beautiful as Elizabeth Taylor.
The soundtrack of the English version is also very good.
I wonder if they ever made a soundtrack album of that.
The subtleties are truly out of this world and the characterization is beyond brilliant.
I do have some complaints though.
Uneven in places but still a lot of fun.
Or couch for that matter either.
I am very picky with my selections.
Stick with it and you will see what I'm talking about.
Then went and bought both acts.
They were even better than I had experienced at first.
Hope it is not lost.
They had to be that good to play that demented.
I like it and recommend it for movie lovers of all ages.
I have not seen another movie like this.
You can not not be impressed by this movie.
A treat to all avid fans of Indian cinema.
A man forced to join a career of a cop by his cop father.
Recommended to all who are interested in nostalgia of serious Hindi films.
Till this movie was made there was no audience for documentaries in India.
Each one played their part par excellence.
His father is a harsh Police Constable.
His compromise towards unethical practice is negative.
Finally he gets suspended.
The Practical approach of Script is a major Punch.
Those aspects are dealt brilliantly.
Words fall short for this great work.
This movie has stood the test of times.
Thus this movie was truly a trend setter.
This trend dominated the Hindi movie scene for more than a decade.
This movie was a moderate box office hit.
This is a very good and a classic film.
Its also interesting how each character is practically the opposite of the other.
Id say though that it turned out just fine.
The Haunted World of Edward D.
Documentary about the infamous Edward D.
covering his life and movies.
There are interviews with people who worked with him or knew him.
Interviews are mixed with clips from the movies or some bizarre recreations.
Wood had ambitions but not a bit of talent to carry them out.
Still it is of interest if you are a Wood fan.
I loved this film.
Not being a swooning Ed Wood Jr.
could not be condensed to a single viewpoint.
This collaborative effort is the closest to knowing him that we can ever get.
Best watched at 3 am while wearing an angora sweater.
The film puts the atrocity into context of the time.
It also shows the savagery of the soldiers on the day of the atrocity.
An excellent and accurate film.
McGovern takes great pains to research and document his writing and it pays off.
Never before seen such a sick and twisted thing.
The Story is good and the actors do their thing very well.
It just all theoretically possible and exciting.
7 or 8 out of 10.
I do not want to give away too much.
The pilot is extremely well done.
It lays out how the characters bond in future episodes.
I do not think anyone could have created a better pilot for this show.
It displays remarkable creativity on the writers part.
I would love to get a copy of it.
Thanks for the assistance.
It just seemed to be believable.
thanks for the hours of entertainment you have provided over the years.
Proper grammar and pronunciation are essential to a film.
However Abby has other plans of her own.
There are also various assorted body parts.
for those with the stomach.
The atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling.
Well its about time.
At the start of the episode the couple are having a conversation.
Abbey has caught Cliff cheating and he is desperately trying to win her back.
And this is just the setup people.
A man and his wife get in a horrible car accident.
My apologies to him for my underestimation.
but this is easily the best episode of the season.
but they may someday end up being masters in the future.
I liked this one a lot.
Do NOT watch whilst eating pudding.
But the fun is in the journey.
then you want a thriller.
This is a romantic comedy.
This is a really old fashion charming movie.
And While You Were Sleeping.
The rest of the cast is fun.
And that is what makes it fun to watch.
The two leads always have to get together.
I liked all the NY characters and I loved the locations.
then this is for you.
This was a great movie.
Her smile is radiant and her beauty can not be disguised.
I do not understand the comments that there was no chemistry between them.
I guess we see what we want to see.
I think you will like it.
A beautiful postcard of New York.
My teenagers liked it too.
This film told a story that felt comfortable but not old or done.
The ending came with a twist which we all liked too.
I recommend it and we need more of these films to watch.
Anybody who appreciates a romantic Movie SHOULD SEE IT.
I caught this film at a test screening.
Was very surprised to find a really sweet and fun story.
Takes place in the best locations in New York.
Made me want to go there.
It was clean and great for whole family.
I think it will do well.
Audience I saw it with loved it.
He sure can and is likable in this movie.
I just can not understand the negative comments about this film.
Thanks Fox for producing it.
The actor who played Jesus was miscast.
I would love to buy the CD.
There are few films or movies I consider favorites over the years.
The Gospel road was one of them.
Besides I am a Johnny Cash fan and it was a brave venture.
I came out surprised and very amused.
She had amazing comedic timing.
And its depiction of contemporary L.
Never before has a movie made L.
We already know the public taste leans heavily toward the mediocre.
I think it had it all.
It made me laugh out loud over a dozen of times.
I think it is a shame it only scored 5.
This had a good story.
it had a nice pace and all characters are developed cool.
Good job in writing.
This is a great film.
I agreed to watch a chick flick and some how ended up with this.
Actually my vote is a 7.
Rock won with his movie.
overall it was actually better then i expected but not by much.
a typical romantic comedy with its moments i guess.
The characters are all funny.
They work together very well.
The real match up is Paul Rudd and Lake Bell.
Over Her Dead Body was a nice little movie.
I do not see how this movie was bad.
I could have dealt with a 5.
I have always looked forward to new episodes with great anticipation.
Snafu shorts were actually quite funny.
It stands up as one of the best of the Private Snafu shorts.
The setting is an Army camp.
This is a highly effective piece of work.
A good way to lose a war is demoralize the enemy.
This cartoon may be 65 years old but it sure has relevance today.
People forget that war could have easily wound up with the other side winning.
It was a tense time.
A surprise emotional ending.
When you will leave the cinema you will be moved.
Especially the opening moments are terrific.
Egon in the meanwhile goes to college and settles with a woman.
The movie is chronological in a way.
A surprise emotional ending.
When you will leave the cinema you will be moved.
But after few episodes I became a fan.
Struggling to the end when all hope is lost.
This is as authentic a scene you can get in rural India.
All said and done this is one good Movie.
although other movies are not far behind.
one man that will never ever disappoint you.
The sets were also pretty good.
And that is when the problems start.
She is sure to win awards for this heated portrayal.
This picture has everything any movie could ever have.
Yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performance.
The movie is not without its share of realism.
Then things go terribly wrong.
Her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible.
The movie was disturbing at moments.
What is most ironic is this is probably her weakest written role to date.
The other good performance was the little kid.
The movie was probably saved desperately by their performances.
This disc is NOT for the faint of heart.
This is the Who at their most powerful.
The Original Drum and Bass.
This concert footage for me is one of their best.
The crowed went wild.
not to mention acting like an Old West gunslinger.
His great vision and creativity really helped this film.
Some of the camera shots in the film were done very well.
I certainly will not be raving about the story of this film.
The dialect and lifestyle details are accurately reminiscent of this region of the Philippines.
I played it a zillion times during Spring 1993 with my friend Andrew.
Then Streets of Rage 2 came out.
And we quickly forgot that this one even existed.
You even have the chance to become Mr.
Streets of Rage also has truly fantastic music.
Easy to get into and hard to put down.
Baddies often walk away from you instead of engaging in combat.
This is especially infuriating with the Level 5 boss.
Lack of combo moves.
Lack of decent weapons.
Bad guy models are repeated far too often.
Davis as Major General George S.
And sometimes not even then.
All i hear about is how poorly the animation is done.
I hope for a sequel very soon.
I do not think Lady Death would transfer well to film.
Then she seeks revenge.
and the rest you better see it from the movie.
If the movies got anymore awesome.
I would have her babies.
And I am female.
Read the comics you will not regret it.
Yes in this movie since Brian P.
the artist for her died we do not get nearly as good artistic work.
Different Strokes for different folks as the saying goes.
Why everyone else hates that is beyond me.
Character development was fine.
I like how they brought the transition from Hope to Lady Death around.
his dark bruiting style was perfect for this kind of movie.
Gotta find a copy somewhere.
I would have preferred that New Yorker Films had translated the title directly.
This film has renewed my interest in French cinema.
All these incidents cause other events that .
But then this is the magic world of cinema.
Stranger things have happened.
The subtitles quite annoyingly gave both parts of a dialog at once.
This occurs in the first few minutes of the film.
All of that is interesting enough.
That kept me guessing for a while.
A chance meeting at the metro sets the tone for the film.
The best part of the movie comes with about 20 minutes left.
The ending to this movie is top notch.
Some folks might think that was an improvement.
These psychological thrillers are less entertainment than some kind of remote therapy.
This one is a pip.
Meanwhile the rest of the family schemes to sabotage the romance.
The results are predictable.
You get a little bit of everything in this movie.
Sexual tension between the sisters.
A little subtle masochism.
One or two of the actors sound vaguely familiar.
The acting is so bad it is hard to believe.
It was shot in and around LA mostly at night and probably without permits.
The end was so bizarre that I thought it was a joke.
That hilarious line is typical of what these naughty sisters say.
The other is got up to look like Marilyn Monroe.
All three sisters are played by starlets.
He had something of a career.
He also is shown sopping wet in a swimsuit.
The movie is not bad.
I truly do not know where it was shown.
The women are scantily dressed.
But the guy seems to be the central focus.
And I think the audience is meant to also.
Make sure to catch it when broadcast.
The perplexing ending is actually quite consistent with the rest of the film.
and I DO mean it.
But rarely a movie worth watching is actually rated under 6.
The movie is not perfect.
Its true rating should be an 8 or a 9.
The best reason to watch was on the Elvira show a few years back.
Elvira delivered the movie with as many laughs as one can.
I was around 7 when I saw this movie first.
Most yeti pictures are fatally undermined by a grave paucity of energy and enthusiasm.
I saw it at a midnight screening in L.
You are the best.
Stargate is the best show ever.
All the actors are absolutely perfect for there roles.
I love the connection between the characters.
If you have not seen this show I very highly recommend it.
Vote 7 and half out of 10.
Instead these guys fight to the death with brutal results.
Several horses get chopped up.
The production is very impressive and the setting is bleak.
Just remember it is not child friendly.
Sadly this has not been true of the films he has made in Hollywood.
I used to LOVE this movie when I was little and I still do.
And It proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed.
This show has been my escape from reality for the past ten years.
I will sadly miss it.
Although Atlantis has filled the hole a small bit.
Robert wrote something that felt close to reality.
From episode one I was hooked.
It has inspired me to do many things that I thought was impossible.
I never want the show to die.
The voice acting for me was what made the movie.
I found it more interesting than that.
This movie has to be my favorite of all time.
or at least I hope that his movies sucked because of these limitations.
This movie is banned in just about every foreign country I can think of.
Just 3 men torturing a woman for about 45 minutes.
The worst is the eye scene.
So I popped this sucker in and sat down.
This ended up not being the case.
The film fails to shock.
The characters had become stale as well.
Colonel Jack O'Neill was the stereotypical hero with emotional baggage.
only allowing his close friends in.
Amanda Tapping joined the cast as Captain Samantha Carter.
Christopher Judge has done quite a bit with a limited character.
He is also a rock.
Davis has done an incredible job with Hammond making him sympathetic and normal.
If not allowed by his superiors to provide troops to support teams off world.
He will go himself.
This gave him confidence.
He still monitors the groups ethics.
He still is lead at providing information that can move any mission forward.
Definitely different from her soldier like character Arin Soon.
I have seen all the guinea pigs and this one is easily the best.
Another movie I'm hiding from my parents.
This movie has no story.
Although I was disgusted by this movie i really liked it.
I guess it fills some kind of purpose.
I have seen the short movie a few years ago.
After that I watch all sequels.
I have already watch the making of Guinea Pig 1.
Also the sequels are excellent in the special effects.
however the scenes with the pinching and the hot oil look very real.
My name is Steve and I run Unearthed Films.
I'm writing this review because I love the Guinea Pig films.
I have seen it all.
from every underground cult sensation to every Hollywood blockbuster.
This review is for the Devils Experiment.
I find it devoid of story which is fine by me.
The Devils Experiment not only delivers but that is all it is.
Why do people bash it.
It make em feel better about themselves.
We all want blood and gore.
My view is biased cause were releasing them but then again it is not.
The Devils Experiment is NOT for everybody.
What happens next was always unpredictable.
They are simply fun to watch.
Just the ultimate masterpiece in my opinion.
It just keeps getting better and better.
Definitely worth a shot.
You are never sure of who is exactly who in this movie.
This is both a quality and a drawback of the script.
As the movie ends you feel that the story lacks a bit of consistency.
But all this is largely compensated by the excellent psychological development.
This is definitely one of the best movies about gambling.
all the while building the story.
I enjoyed this show for two reasons 1.
Richard Dean Anderson 2.
The chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous.
This relationship carries over into the program we get to see.
You watch the others roll their eyes in dismay at some of his utterances.
He understands what to do without having to think about the matter.
The quality declined markedly in seasons 9 and 10.
Amanda Tapping was phoning in her performances these two seasons.
You could see her greatly changed appearance after having a baby.
She was probably thinking more about the child than the show.
The major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original.
The use of torches for illumination in these ships is just as bad.
I wondered about some of the continuity on the show too.
The patient was in on the con from the beginning.
This is very nearly a perfect film.
It has a definite Hitchcock slant to it.
ten year later perhaps.
Here she gets involved with Joe Mantegna.
I loved this series at first.
I thought it was all brilliant.
I loved them all.
Not a big deal.
It is a worthy successor to this brilliant series.
Davis died a few weeks ago.
It is a great loss.
House of Games is spell binding.
There are few movies I have seen that can grip you so quickly.
From the opening scene this movie just gets you.
From the moment the movie is over it begs to be replayed.
Joe Mantegna was also wonderful.
At least in the beginning.
With the arrival of Mantegna things pick up.
The camera is very cinematic.
The best chunk is in the middle.
I will admit the setup is pretty improbable.
To say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense.
Some have complained that Dr.
House of Games is a wonderful movie at multiple levels.
It is a fine mystery and a shocking thriller.
At this level it does succeed admirably.
House of Games sticks to its business.
As usual you really ought to see this film in a movie theater.
It should be a natural for film festivals.
Nominate it for one near you if you get the chance.
Better she should see it on a TV than not at all.
An extremely enjoyable film experience that is worth repeated viewings.
And nothing is what it seems.
I will watch it again and again.
Bruce is a guy who is unhappy with his life.
God comes to Bruce and grants him Godly powers.
Bruce uses these powers to get everything he has always wanted.
This movie was inspirational and deep.
This is one of those movies that they did too much promoting for.
If you watch T.
Just do not go see this movie expecting to be surprised.
I absolutely loved this movie.
It met all expectations and went beyond that.
It also had a message.
This movie had me laughing and crying.
It also sends a message that we should all know and learn from.
If you liked liar liar you will love this movie.
What better comic genius to remind us of that than Jim Carry.
Morgan Freeman was just right as God.
My biggest complaint is that they should have used more biblical references.
Bruce Almighty was enjoyable.
Eight out of ten stars.
The only purpose this movie has is to make the viewer laugh several times.
I laughed out loud and left with a smile.
This movie is very entertaining though.
The movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance.
In fact all the characters are great.
His character is like all of us.
Morgan Freeman made a great God.
I laughed my ASS off during Liar Liar and Ace Ventura.
Morgan Freeman makes a VERY cool God.
A very funny movie.
It was definitely worth the price of admission.
He was both funny and sad.
I am glad they made a sequel to this film.
God confronts him and show Bruce the error of his ways.
The deleted scenes are priceless.
And it is really funny.
This coherence gives the show exceptional staying power.
I found this highly amusing.
Enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies.
China O'Brien returns home to help out her dad.
Maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned.
I found it to be better than the short story it was based on.
The two try to learn a way to save her.
The ending is sad but has an interesting final moment that makes it touching.
Upon arriving he is given an injection and is curious as to why.
A nice story with a heartwarming conclusion.
And the first 20 minutes of the film only heightened that feeling of anticipation.
It has said that The Movies and Baseball both thrived during The Great Depression.
The literature of the time also flourished at all levels.
There were mediums that were ancestral to them.
The other direct ancestor was the Pulp Magazine.
Each of them was an expert in a given field.
We are also puzzled about Mr.
I can remember seeing it quite vividly.
It explains a lot of the stuff that the movie neglected to mention.
That was only the beginning of the adventure.
Unlock the gate and step through.
Ron Ely is just right as Doc.
Doc Savage does not have the extensive location work that Raiders has.
The best way to approach this film is to just RELAX and enjoy.
Overall a great movie to watch on a rainy day.
I give it 7 out of 10.
But they are very close to the feel of the pulps.
This is a VERY entertaining movie.
IT WAS NOT MADE THAT WAY.
All of the actors are obviously having fun while entertaining us.
The actors were not trying to emulate Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan.
This is NOT one of those martial arts films.
An unmissable treat for the whole family.
Ron Ely is a God.
Somerset Maugham stories which comprise the film.
The performances and attention to detail were wonderful to watch.
Both have a rather large number of somewhat cheesy accents and wonderful character actors.
The children ARE a bit tedious and could have been edited.
Again the author introduces the film and the stories.
Soon he has a whole chain of stores.
I will not describe the way Max rises to the occasion.
Culver watches as three stories among these characters play out to their conclusions.
The film ends after the court sums up.
This film delivers an effective story that stays with you once it has finished.
He betrays everything and everybody without an ounce of remorse.
The performance is one of the most chilling performances I have ever seen.
I still can not get over it.
But here she proves she up to the task of heavier drama.
Knox as the Nazi is brilliant.
He charts the course of a Nazi career.
the movie really shines in a couple of areas.
The phone conversation across the border is really memorable.
He has taken the bus to visit his son Norman is Los Angeles.
So RF attempts to reach his wife in Mexico.
I will kill him.
It ends less predictably than you would think.
There was so much that was just off.
You can find the URL in my email address above.
Say what you will about schmaltz.
It is inspiring because it is about people of noble purpose.
It can not all be blamed on Mr.
I'm not comparing George Bush to Adolph Hitler.
The movie had me laughing from start to finish.
and have no profile at all today.
It is very funny and YES very rude and hilariously all wrong.
Just as it should be.
I wish there were more films like this.
Entertaining if a little on the long side.
I found the movie and the performances fun and enjoyable.
Williams is a jewel.
There are a lot of laughs in the process.
Melvyn Douglas proved again that he had few peers in light comedy.
Joan Blondell was at the peak of her career and is a delight.
This movie is very good.
The screenplay is enchanting.
Her performance is excellent.
She brings me to go into the heart of her role.
Paul Lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family.
but the dialog is just bad at times.
but that is really about all.
I believe they were telling the truth the whole time.
U cant trust anything in the wild.
They family went through hell.
Those poor boys too young to understand what was going on around them.
As well as dealing with the lose of their little sister.
I cant believe this case went on for so long.
I think everyone should watch this.
8 out of 10.
Religious bigotry is rampant everywhere.
Australia is not immune to it.
This is a very moving motion picture with a terrific cast of actors.
Those with supporting roles are also quite good.
You will remember this movie for many years.
and they deliver in every way.
A CRY IN THE DARK far exceeded my expectations.
A Cry in the Dark is likewise clinical.
What followed was a gross miscarriage of justice.
The whole country was abuzz with whispers of a ritual killing.
A very good effort by the master of that trade.
A strong Aussie cast lend compelling support.
Truly a must for all conscientious Australians.
I found it hard to like anyone in this film.
What is infuriating is that it is not that difficult.
It is difficult enrapture an audience when you purposely deny them insights into yourself.
The story behind the movie is fascinating in and of itself.
The cast just makes it that much more appealing.
Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was inspiring.
I think she is worth all 10 or so of her Oscar nominations.
A pretty good film.
Their is more to the plot but you can find that out for yourself.
Not everyone goes into wild melodramatic hysterics to every major crisis.
It captured the themes of the story brilliantly.
Where this really stands out is the acting.
The performances are excellent.
There is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this.
I recommend this to any fellow fan of such.
Lindy Chamberlain was this woman.
She is subsequently arrested and put on trial.
Only after years in jail was he exonerated.
This is one of those movies.
It proves that people are the same the world over.
You will probably get blown away just by what you see here.
I really felt for her when Lindy was being persecuted.
It turned out to be better than I had anticipated.
Paul Lukas was certainly deserving of his Oscar.
Bette Davis shines brilliantly as the great actress and beauty she was.
Some movies seem to be made before we are ready for them.
Today these circuses have become common but that makes the lesson only more important.
The Aussie accents get a bit thick at times but not incomprehensible.
ROLL is a wonderful little film.
Parts of it reminded me of LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING Barrels.
I really want to visit Australia one day.
Some of the best filmmakers in the are Australian.
The cinematography in ROLL was especially impressive.
I loved the stylized colors and lighting in many of the scenes.
Mat is unlikely to have a quiet evening in before his big day.
Toby and Damien were well cast together and did an outstanding job.
And then things go wrong.
I have just watched Roll and what a pleasure it turned out to be.
Watch out for these two.
I am of course kidding.
He feels that FDR connived the U.
Paul Lukas deserved the Oscar he won.
They are moneyed people who could silently advance evil simply by not opposing it.
i will keep checking in.
it also has some of the same delicacy and persistent poignancy.
The previous reviewer has said it exactly.
I still remember some of the scenes.
I recall going to the library researching all that I could on this story.
I even wrote to the PBS station for more information.
There was one other bidder but I was determined to win this movie.
The losing bidder wrote me asking for a copy which I gave her.
Almost 30 years later I recall this original PBS film as almost unbearably tender.
Bo and Luke Duke help Uncle Jesse run Moonshine in the General Lee.
Coltrane was way too serious.
Back to the movie.
The real star is of course the General Lee.
The car chases and stunts are excellent and that is really what D.
And I really enjoyed this flick.
I enjoyed myself here a lot more than I did with other summer blockbusters.
And as far as the plot goes.
It was the perfect Dukes plot.
And I would have like a little bit more incompetence from Sheriff Roscoe.
In the movie Roscoe is a little.
I saw this movie when I was a child.
It blew me away.
I would recommend this movie to any and everyone.
The color was outstanding.
I even liked most of the actors in it.
Davis they would be laughed off the screen.
The possible exception is Now Voyager.
I absolutely adore this film.
Some of the back story on this production is fascinating.
This is a beautiful movie filled with adventure.
The Genii in the bottle is a classic scene.
I loved every minute of it.
A fantastic Arabian adventure.
He collects amazing toys from around the world.
And the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful.
But it is not so much their effectiveness as the audacity of the inventions.
Also impressing is the climax with its wonderful flying carpet.
Of course good gets a little help from an unlikely source.
Not a bad message to be sending out in 1940 at that.
Everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end.
Probably the finest fantasy film ever made.
Doubtless Spielberg and Lucas were enthralled by this one.
Every frame has its own magical charm.
Here is a film that will never grow old.
I have never passed up an opportunity to watch it throughout the intervening years.
This remarkable picture ranks as one of the finest fantastic films of all time.
8 out of 10.
Here is a villain worth watching.
The rest of the cast do fine work.
The two escape and take a boat to the city of Basra.
Ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden.
Then he is captured.
The Prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her.
He does awaken her.
His first is for sausages.
He has the genie take him to Ahmad.
Ahmad uses the eye to see the princess.
She smells a flower and forgets everything at once.
The production designs are just stunning in this movie.
From the palaces to the different dangerous traps that the heroes encounter.
The music and songs are also well done.
A wonderful film highlighting American positive propaganda against a wicked foe.
Rex Ingram made me believe in genies.
He set the bar very high.
I watch this movie at least twice a year.
and never tire of it.
This film is an adventure for all ages.
I was ten years old the first time I saw it and the U.
was just about to enter WWII.
Yet they fit into the story well.
The effects fit with the script.
Everything is just so beautiful.
The sets are beautiful.
Those effects still work their charm.
The giant genie is ably acted by Rex Ingram.
Butler and Tom Howard.
Both men had long and distinguished careers in technical wizardry.
This is one of the best of its kind.
I have to agree with MR.
Lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this work.
Lukas fought in Spain on the Republican side and was wounded there.
His health has not been the same since.
His family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes.
Those decisions affect all the other members of the cast.
The MGM art and music departments also did a good job.
Also notice that Ms.
This is a most handsome film.
There is precious little in the story line that relates to actual events.
These web sites can be located by using any good search engine.
There are also several books available concerning his life history.
He was singing Jose in Carmen in San Francisco the night of the earthquake.
His acting is natural and genuine.
And why should it.
To say that liberties were taken with his life is to be modest.
His contribution to the recording industry is treated as almost an afterthought.
The result was a wonderful movie.
I like it because of my recent personal experience.
Especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite.
The movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory.
Before Sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head.
The end was not quite important after all.
Movies are supposed to be enjoyable.
This is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it.
I am on a journey too.
The movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions.
But will this newfound relationship last past sunrise.
I am now restless waiting for the weekend so I can see the sequel.
Will soften even the hardiest heart.
I'm not usually a fan of strictly romantic movies but heard this was good.
Easily the most romantic thing I have ever seen in my life.
The chemistry is flawless as is the writing and directing.
You can not look away nor can you stop listening to them.
Even the little moments just melt your heart.
On the train he met a French girl Celine.
Then the romantic story unfolded.
At first they were cautious.
The funniest scene was their listening to CD in music store.
Their deep love for each other was expressed completely by words.
Love is a strange thing.
Love needs mutual understanding.
Spiritual harmony is the most important for love.
Excellent screenplay and performance resulted in huge success of the movie.
One of the best romance movies.
the most amazing combination of love and psyche of two young people.
presented in the most sublime manner and definitely touches your heart.
the movie re affirms your faith in love and pain of separation.
the joy of seeing your most beloved is unparalleled and anything can be sacrificed.
A must see movie for all the people who believe in true love.
What the actors bring out is what becomes of them .
right or wrong even the idea bearers would find it difficult to justify.
This is a slow moving story.
I really mean that.
Still it did not ruin the movie.
The dialog is fascinating.
The build up to the finale is satisfying and in the end rewarding.
Krebs of the nineties.
I was totally satisfied with the outcome and everything else.
But it certainly spoke to me.
They must have improvised during some parts and it works well.
They have a great chemistry in their roles.
I get the feeling that this was a very personal work for Mr.
It definitely touched me and I hope it touches others just as much.
Of course my favorite character was the Grandmother played by Lucile Watson.
But I loved the way Betty Davis and her family was portrayed.
did not act like children in the slightest.
This movie is intelligent.
The actors play absolutely brilliantly.
Balancing on this fine line demands outrageously talented actors.
This is simply a gem of a movie that you can not miss.
The dialog is perfect.
They talk and fall in love.
This is a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one viewing.
See it and it may change your way of life.
i watched this movie 10 years ago.
and have watched it on video an average of once a year since.
We are too afraid to check that out.
It does not strike me as totally wrong.
Few can claim that.
It has dialog with bite in it.
And what it says is quite true.
It also has moments of near poetry.
Hellman could write very well at times.
Dialog and acting are great.
I love the characters and their ideas and thoughts.
But that is not the point.
Their story is what we ever wanted and probably most of us never reached.
This was so clever and touching.
I want to go to Vienna.
I want to see them as soon as possible again.
They are both masterpieces.
I'm sorry for my English which i m trying to best.
My vote is ten.
Before Sunrise is romance for the slacker generation.
Adding to the beauty of the film is the city of Vienna.
Before Sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating.
Before Sunrise is what it is.
This movie focuses purely on watching the budding of a beautiful romance.
What makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is.
This is exactly they way you would dream that you meet that special someone.
It just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana that the film suggests.
One can not help but be touched deeply by looking at this movie.
We have several dimensions of love that contributes to the value of this movie.
There is the divine love of God that is beautifully portrayed.
There is the love in a marriage.
He knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated.
Talk to someone and let them know you love them.
Love does no good unless it is given to another.
this movie has a real feel to it.
Give this film your full attention and its message will truly inspire.
Her leftist views were not well regarded at the time in the country.
The adaptation is credited to Ms.
They are crossing the border to the United States from Mexico.
They are to continue toward Mrs.
We find out that Mr.
The film offers excellent acting all around.
This was a good film with a powerful message of love and redemption.
Loved the film and it brought tears to my eyes.
A Vow to Cherish is a wonderful movie.
The main characters experience inner struggles and cope with extremely hard decisions.
I know that it may seem a bit idealistic.
Ken Howard is also memorable as the faithful husband.
But nobody forces you to do so.
The ending is very predictable but satisfying.
She displays a knack for comedy as well as an ability to do drama.
The mechanics of the film are a lot of fun too.
The camera displays sophisticated late silent techniques like mobility.
The title cards are also incredibly clever.
I remember seeing promos for this show before it appeared back in 1993.
I will tell you a tale of the summer of 1994.
Desmond Howl had it all.
Canadian cinema suffers from several problems.
who are now still trying to become adults.
and they are having such a hard time adjusting to a regular life.
as they see the new bands etc getting the spotlight.
it is almost like they have to begin anew.
and that is where I find the film sad and depressing.
and she is one lady in a film you will cheer for.
This is an almost perfect movie.
sad but in a way positive.
because of the whales.
I do not know why.
I was in a bad frame of mind when I first saw this movie.
I was amazingly impressed by this movie.
He finds a companion who comes with her own issues.
Des is an unlikely character by todays standards of a rock star.
Yet he has musical genius.
Claire is the streetwise kid that needs a place to stay.
She finds hidden talents while being in Des company.
She also finds a mutual friend that accepts her.
She learns to trust him over a period of time.
These two find love with one another.
two of them in fact.
The bailiff comes by to tell her that she is in a huge debt.
I thought my jawbones would burst.
The acting was outstanding in this movie.
He just cracks me up.
Watch this movie if you ever get a chance.
This is an hilarious movie.
It can also make you laugh so hard your health will improve.
I love this film.
Either would have killed the film completely.
The music was good though not great but filled out the movie nicely.
Her dearly departed has left her with no money and outstanding debts.
Craig Ferguson is equally amiable as Matthew.
The film is thoroughly likable and always amusing.
The supporting cast also does a fine job.
The premise alone is appealing.
And the film plays around with the premise wisely every now and then.
You just might feel more than a little festive after seeing it.
This light hearted comedy should be enjoyed for entertainment value.
The cast of characters meld well together and are quite believable in their roles.
How Grace handles meeting her dead husbands girlfriend was well played.
The last five minutes cost it 2 points in my rating.
I saw Saving Grace right after it came out on video.
The characters are what makes the movie so good.
You will love it.
This film was brilliant.
It was beautifully acted in the more serious scenes and the funny moments were .
I just thought it was excellent and I still do.
Sisters in law will be released theatrically on march 24th in Sweden.
A good occasion for our Nordic friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary.
Games with this much replay value are few and far between.
Super Mario 64 is undoubtedly the greatest game ever created.
but I hope to achieve them eventually.
The controls are great.
The Bowser fights are challenging.
good for playing in short bursts of time.
I heard that Luigi and Yoshi are in the game towards the end.
The characters are really great.
Especially for it is time.
I found the graphics in the water courses very very good.
This is my favorite part of the game.
Or at least one of the best.
It beats out mediocre Super Mario Sunshine any day.
I have played this game plenty of times and its good every time.
This game is amazing.
Although it is ancient now it was amazing when it came out.
I believe that this game will always be a classic.
You can spend four hours in one level.
You enter the world by going through a painting.
10 out of 10.
There is brief language in this.
I recommend this to any fan of romance stories.
I only hope this film gets a wide release in the United States.
My biggest criticism is the scenery.
It is far too lush.
England has never been like this.
It looks like a chocolate box.
Only Americans would make it like this.
Despite these criticisms I enjoyed this film but would recommend the TV adaptation more.
I wish she had read a little more.
She will hopefully be around for a real long time.
It is one of those old stories that are still accurate those days.
I specially like it when she sings a duet.
I thought you overqualified.
The film is though for some reason very entertaining and I loved it.
Her growing romance with the unparalleled Mr.
Knightly with his poise and nobility.
This is a powerful documentary about domestic abuse in the Cameroon.
And the movie they made deserves a wide audience.
a really enjoyable and deserving movie.
The acting is competent.
Emma is a true romance.
He makes and excellent romantic lead.
It enhances the movie to heights that are extraordinary.
They nearly steal the show.
But it is with characters like Emma that she really shines.
And that is the magic of the movies.
Emma is that movie.
One of the beaten wives also is seeking a divorce.
The outcomes in each case are favorable to the women and children.
This is a highly important and well made film.
What a delightful film.
Toni Collette was great as Harriett Smith.
One of the most endearing characters I have come across in ages.
From one of the opening scenes when she is thanking Mr.
I hope that this film delights you all as much as it has myself.
I love this movie.
This movie is definitely on my top 10 list of good movies.
Make the World go away.
Get it off my shoulder.
Then they start to improve their live by hating away memories.
The sound effects during this were great.
Things really got weird at the end.
It just has to be seen.
the only word that sums up this movie is quirky.
8 out of ten.
I was in for a surprise.
without working that hard.
People complain about the movie being too simple or too boring.
The judges waste no time in lashing out at the woman with fury.
The two leads are great and really carry the film.
This should become a cult favorite.
I thought this was an awesome movie.
It was very weird and unrealistic.
The big cable company is mainly what I'm talking about.
Everything fit together well.
The plain white cover and title intrigued me.
it would have done very well indeed.
It had the audience laughing the whole time.
See it if you can.
I would love to write some more but am on quite a time limit.
However I encourage anyone and everyone to give this film a try.
They live in a strange looking house beneath two freeways.
They are left alone.
They have chemistry and also work very well.
Keep your eyes peeled for this guy.
but it won me over by the end.
just do not ask me to explain it.
And of course that is exactly what happens.
The rest of the story places Dave and Andrew in this world of nothingness.
The entire world of nothing is white.
white no matter in what direction you look.
This is the weakness of this film.
One of the best parts of the film is the set.
Nothing features digital visual effects and prosthetics that equals any modern horror film.
We do not know where they are or what has happened to them.
You will be glad you did.
But that is where even more problems begin.
Just say you hate it and why you hate it.
The direction of the mass scenes in the rehearsal rooms was enormously well done.
The story never really got lost in this frantic pace.
These sequences got a lot a chuckles from the audience as well.
All in all a great film with a sour ending.
The ice cream cone is invented in New York.
Got to be a new record.
And he could dance.
Basically he was a leading man in the body of a character actor.
Such energy and vitality.
I thought I was just going to be rewarded with a small headache.
One of the last releases before the Motion Picture Production Code was strictly enforced.
Gentility and morality made sure of it.
Chester has trouble with people trying to steal his ideas for his shows.
This is a very entertaining film with lots of comedy and plenty of laughs.
One of the best musicals ever.
I would love to know.
How anyone can say this is bad is beyond me.
I loved this show before I even saw it.
Jessica Alba and 3.
The girls are sure game.
They come up smiling with water in their eyes and still hit their marks.
The whole thing must have been incredibly difficult and exhausting.
a human picture forms of Franklin Roosevelt and the NRA eagle.
The movie is full of juicy clichés that make us smile.
And it needs to be said that he was not bad at it.
He plays the role with a lot of confidence.
So do the characters and actors that are portraying them.
Once again the musical numbers also feature a young Billy Barty.
A recommendable early genre movie.
But we always have the movies as a way to escape our troubles.
Apparently Blondell was the only other woman who Cagney loved apart from his wife.
And you can see the mutual adoration in every scene.
This is a wonderful film.
The musical productions of Busby Berkeley will never be duplicated.
I think this movie easily outdoes all of his other efforts.
Joan Blondell and James Cagney are incredible together.
Cagney is always terrific.
I do not understand the John Garfield issue though.
I found it on Turner Classics.
I found it by wonderful accident.
But this is a pretty strange movie.
After a while it gets a bit too much.
But none of them really mean anything.
Cagney and Blondell have excellent chemistry and their scenes go off really well.
From that point of view it is utter fantasy.
I will gladly watch this film again and again and again and.
But it is all in fun.
7 out of 10.
Herman Bing is hilarious in his one tiny scene as a music arranger.
These are all scenes from a 1933 musical.
Kent is basically an idea man along the lines of choreographer Busby Berkeley.
It has a story.
She is the perfect partner for James Cagney .
Those behind the curtains were hit as bad as those in front.
Some other competitors get wind of it and the competition is on.
But it is so creative and fun to watch.
John Garfield is seen briefly in the Shanghai Lil number.
I think the brothers Warner were playing a little joke there.
I have got to believe that clip was deliberate.
Note the African guys mixed into the scene with white and Asian prostitutes.
Here the black guys are sitting at the bar and singing with the others.
wholeheartedly supported the uplift dictated by the F.
In a few months the Production Code would eliminate such naughty pleasures.
The overall effect is highly erotic and mesmerizing.
A thoroughly enjoyable Depression era romp.
A dark fable for adults.
I hope that a box set of Longstreet will appear.
I also believe that Dark Angel will become a cult favorite.
Thus enabling them to continue their struggle.
Well worth a viewing.
The producers must have got something right.
Not to be missed.
The ability to make jokes about that climate was equally important.
I do not think this is the point of the film at all.
I commend pictures that try something different.
A real window into a specific time and place in history.
Could almost believe this was a true story in a parallel universe.
Gotta start with Ed Furlong on this one.
God bless this kid.
Maybe that is why his performance was good.
The twists keep on coming.
Not glossed over a bit.
These guys are twins.
And some of them are smoking hot.
Merry mayhem is what would happen.
I have to say I totally loved the movie.
It shows how a young gay boy would be treated while growing up.
I had friends who were picked on for one thing or another .
And if you need it explained to you .
This film has good characters with excellent performances from the cast.
The slick soundtrack betrays the murder ballad tone of the film.
I just finished watching this film and found it very enjoyable.
And David plays the bad guy to perfection.
There is much more to this film than first meets the eye.
His character held my attention.
The other people in the story were essential in the makeup of his character.
The way they banded together to help one another was truly awe inspiring.
This is one of the most interesting movies I have ever seen.
I love the backwoods feel of this movie.
The movie is very realistic and believable.
Henry Thomas works well with the young baby.
Very moving story and worth a look.
I saw this film last night on cable and it is extraordinary.
This film is wonderfully atmospheric.
I recommend it highly.
I think that Fox has done it again.
This movie is great to make fun of.
Rent it for a good laugh.
And that is when they meet Ernest Keller.
And he offers to let them stay at his home.
Just seeing this cast in these scenes makes it worth a look.
Barbara Bach and Doug Barr make nice eye candy.
This film is creepy yet cheesy at the same time.
I rated it an 8 out of 10.
His persistent friendliness and almost naturally perverted appearance are exactly what the character needed.
The final shot is especially sad.
Get this film if at all possible.
The gals ask around but there is just nowhere to go.
Bach finally gets home and wants to know where her friends are.
A real treat for your collection.
all the acting done in the first season has been really amazing.
the minis do the best acting job that i have ever seen kids do.
the main actors and actresses i.
Jessica Alba Michael Weatherly etc.
make you forget you are watching a fictional t.
show they seem to make this show come alive.
all in all this is the best show i have ever watched.
One is the art direction.
The other thing is the comic timing.
I thought I should qualify my position after reading other reviews.
The lighting and scenes along with the camera work are great.
The music is pretty good and the gore is good.
There was no sex scenes.
I gave it 7 out of 10 and I think that is fair.
I would watch it again if I had nothing better to do.
The film just wanders along its merry way with very little development.
A decent effort and worth seeing IF you like serial killer flicks.
Campbell is to check this film out anyway and see what else Mr.
Campbell are trying to show you.
Check this one out.
I think this show is definitely the greatest show.
Jessica Alba does such a great job in it.
It was a revelation to us.
Obviously we were wrong.
But we both chose that love anyway.
That kind of stuff is for the Christian wackos.
As we aged we stopped having extramarital affairs.
This story is not far fetched.
My wife and I have been sleeping together for the last 40 years.
We are still gay.
It is a fantasy not unlike a cinder girl becoming a Princess.
Pretty boys being looked after by older not so pretty men.
Bathhouses were an integral part of the gay community.
This movie is as unique as it is overlooked.
The only other problem with that is that Stella herself is a lesbian.
What she finds will leave the viewer stunned.
What was lacking for me was a coherent storyline.
If you take it too seriously the audience will find little to enjoy.
The budget of around 10 million has not been well spent.
The opening action is okay but after that the good moments become more sparse.
There are some good moments.
As for the cast.
Hidden Agenda boasted the best cast Dolph has worked with in ages.
This however has problems.
The actors are on the most part bad.
This movie is all about Dolph though.
It also marks a turning point in his career.
This is an absolute great show.
She is definitely one of a kind and absolutely gorgeous.
This should be higher then 4.
There is a bit of blood and violence.
Jennifer Baxter is very cute and is good as The fiancée.
rest of the cast do fine.
I just viewed Detention last night and i liked what i saw.
It was a cool fun movie.
Dolph looked superbly cool on the Bike.
He also looked good in this movie as compared to his other recent movies.
He is now in a pretty good shape.
But it also had its share of Problems.
Another problem which i had was the way the students were swearing.
The third problem was that the bad guys were very few in numbers.
There should have been more bad guys.
Overall the movie was a good Movie.
I would recommend others to watch it.
Now u r a DEAD beat cop.
Rarely has something free been so worth invaluable.
He would deal with her later.
It was led by a German American taking his cue directly from the homeland.
These great films may be too simplistic for World War II history buffs.
It was truly a lot of fun.
The special effects were wonderful.
Blair Witch and The Mummy.
Both films that I thought were terrible.
Blair was probably the most overrated horror film of all time.
People liked it for it is special effects.
But that is about it.
A lot of computer generated special effects and nothing more.
Check this one out and form your own opinion on it.
I give this picture 7 out of 10.
Some films just simply should not be remade.
This is one of them.
In and of itself it is not a bad film.
But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more.
I do not know why the critics trashed this movie.
I hardly ever agree with them anyway.
Liam was great as always.
The special and sound effects were awesome.
I know it is fashionable now to hate this movie.
I have seen it 15 times now and it gets better every time.
The Haunting lets go and is certainly not boring.
The old Haunting was also a fine film from 1963.
It was even more scary.
What I wish could have happened is for something a little more intense.
The Haunting could have used a few more scenes of pure terror.
The acting is good and there are moments that make you jump.
I just wish it scared me more.
It seems to be a perfect day for swimming.
There is a double question the movie poses.
Some psychological battling there.
It just absolutely rattled me.
I was on vacation with my aunts in Ft.
The plot is about as simple as it gets.
The friction between them is a hoot.
Still a sturdy thriller which builds to an exciting and edifying conclusion.
He died in 1988.
It just makes me feel good.
The two are like apples and oranges.
I watched this movie after seeing it on Broadway.
I love the Broadway musical and I love the movie.
I watched the movie like it was not related to the Broadway show.
I danced for 12 years before I had to make a choice.
I was however super talented as a show rider.
and dedicate to one or the other.
I love the movie.
I love the Broadway musical.
Douglas is also probably not the best choice for the part.
but best of all.
i suggest you do to.
I love this movie.
This is a great movie.
That is an incorrect view.
And that I think is really the point of the whole show.
This is a study of life as a Broadway star.
This is a great musical.
The estate looked like an old prison.
His portrayal of Johnny and the fanatical following he inspired was very frightening.
Ann Heywood was also very good as the cynical Cathie.
Thank heavens for Turner Classic which aired the show last week.
Some of the boys are a bit scary.
Time has helped heal those wounds.
Understandably because of this the film is seldom aired or available to modern audiences.
Also has the best signature tune of any comedy show.
The comedy rests on the mix of the people sharing.
A man and two women.
Ironically the party was held to say goodbye to their old flatmate.
The obvious ends up happening as he moves in.
What a pity modern comedy can not reach that high standard.
This was in fact untrue.
They are so impressed by his culinary skills that they invite him to stay.
But there must be no naughty business.
So Robin has to pretend to be gay.
She was not alone.
He worked so well he was made into a regular.
Most of its characters had never appeared in the series.
His attention to use of light within scenes is remarkable.
The ending is wonderful.
I must confess that I was completely shocked by this film.
If you think you are into this kind of thing then go.
Overall the film is about real people in an unusual situation.
The second season though suddenly became a bit odd compared to the first.
So I really wish they could start making new episodes.
And with James Cameron behind this it can not go wrong.
I caught this on the dish last night.
I liked the movie.
I liked the look Ben Chaplin has through the whole movie.
Rent it or catch it on the dish like I did.
Maybe they are too implausible.
Birthday Girl is a movie I have enjoyed several times.
Rest of the cast are fine.
I know what I'm talking about.
You will love it.
I spent a ton of time putting it together.
So check it out.
You can not just order her to arrive at your airport.
US Immigration would NEVER allow such a thing to happen.
This is not Great Cinema but I was most entertained.
Given most films these days this is High Praise indeed.
Every time I see Nicole I like her more.
I love a movie like this.
Funny how people miss the point.
I forgot what a gorgeous woman she is.
Some unexpected turns in the story are good for the suspense.
A small funny film.
One think is sure too.
Here she is a natural woman and she does a really great job.
Instead it accurately records necessary growth arising from the films unique circumstances.
Maybe it is just makeup but it was amazing.
Despite my gratuitous digs at Ms.
Nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is.
The society is suffering from corruption.
The atmosphere is astounding.
It proved to be quite worthy of watching.
She just keeps proving that she is one of the top talents in Hollywood.
This film is definitely an odd love story.
until two hours of write this.
The woman that he finds comes from Russia.
And I'm not sorry in say that this is a masterpiece.
Three out of four stars.
The acting is first class and the characters are represented well.
My vote is eight.
This is not a big budget film.
Rather it is a film that has a strong community feel.
it is to behold .
But it is a less glamorous and more in you face tale.
The Scots excel at storytelling.
She makes the characters come alive.
The same story is told in bars the length and breadth of Scotland.
The discussion continued to closing time.
Stories passed down like this become part of our being.
And also introduces the story that stretches back through generations.
It produces stories within stories.
The stuff of legend.
This is what gives it its special charm.
He burns with frustration.
Yet there is a deeper conflict within him.
He yearns to know the truth.
She has done numerous guest spots and commercials up here in Canada.
Finally someone has the sense to create a show for her.
The supporting case seems quite good too.
I have now watched the pilot several times and I still find it refreshing.
It is a fresh idea and hopefully it does well.
One thing I just thought of though.
Shame on Global for pulling the plug on this one.
I thought this one would be a winner.
It is a great story and also inspires others.
It is unfortunate that the Challenger Accident delayed and hurt the movie.
The 20th Anniversary of the Challenger Accident is coming up.
Julia has been growing up fast.
Wow are we ever going to miss his movies if society collapses.
definitely needed a little work in season 2.
Very good drama in season two.
I was seriously hoping for a third and final season.
I would recommend this as a nice night in movie and a 7 Vote.
Just a cute movie with some subtle comedy to lighten things up.
I personally really like movies like this from time to time.
Nothing too deep or too scary.
Just a nice story line.
And I would have never known Mr.
Phoenix had I not recently read the credits.
He was just a baby really when he made this movie.
Kelly Preston was quite the young budding actress then too.
She and Lea did a wonderful job in this movie.
I agree it is not an Oscar caliber movie.
But very much worth watching.
Or ones that are interested in the space program.
Space Camp is a pretty decent film.
The scene where the shuttle doors open in space is simply spectacular.
it just looks average.
I remember this scene in the theater.
It made you feel like you were really up there.
I was quite impressed.
This film is none of those.
SO sit back with your kids and prepare to enjoy.
The perfect space fantasy film.
This would not be a family film if they all died.
Then it will all be sad.
That sucks so bad.
This film is the best for sure.
And the oxygen in ship was running short.
The view was great from outer space.
It does not look unreal.
i would like to comment the series as a great effort.
I'm glad they did.
Which really enhanced the viewing a lot.
I had never heard of the others in the movie.
I finally found it available in a certain store and bought it.
I will probably have it forever.
This movie gets a 9 out of 10 from me.
Watching this movie again really brought back some great childhood memories .
It was just like revisiting my childhood.
It was an absolutely amazing experience for me.
I will always cherish this movie for that reason.
Those outlets can only show you what happened on the outside.
This film shows you what happened on the INSIDE.
It is a sight you will not soon forget.
We must never forget.
Now I have seen the movie.
Thank God I did.
It offered me closure.
I can now move on with my life.
As the second plane crashes the people understand that this is not an accident.
No other documentary even comes close.
I can not see how this could have been done any different.
I have read most of the comments here.
But I do not think narration is unnecessary.
Like I lot of theorists I think that our own lives are narrations.
We are living and making our own autobiography.
We create a story about our live.
Because in the form of a story we can identify ourselves.
So that is the purpose of adding a story in documentary.
If it was me out there I would be worried sick about my brother.
In my view it would have been better to leave this out.
Nevertheless it is compelling viewing for the depiction of the events.
Conspiracy theorists can go to hell by the way.
Jules asked the captain to follow him into the Towers.
It took me a year to come to grips with the devastation.
I was sick of hearing about it.
It was the first time I had cried since the attack.
I highly recommend this documentary.
These two brothers make me want to have been there to help.
This movie had nobody known.
To sum this documentary up in a few words is next to impossible.
The story was thought up by two French brothers living in New York.
Then the unthinkable occurs.
His work is professional through his baptism of fire.
It ranks up there with the Hindenburg footage in showing history as it unfolds.
I also commend CBS for their bravery at airing this special.
Heroism at its finest and the cost of freedom.
I can not just choose one scene that stood out for me.
There was truly a disturbance in the Force.
This documentary vividly reveals this disturbance.
The feelings are so incredibly visual.
Not a thing is missed.
This is a powerful and most moving documentary and well deserving of the Emmy.
You will need them.
I know that I did.
This is an amazing documentary about a shocking day.
I beg you to consider the fact that the documentary was made.
The courage that it took to shoot this film is most notable.
We find that the two brothers are split up when that moment happened.
I submit a wholehearted 10.
Action will never reach this level.
It spoke of things inescapable to the eye of the camera.
It is art without question or questions.
Tears came to my eyes watching this documentary.
All my memories returned and just the intense images were unbelievable.
How these guys were able to capture this footage was incredible.
That reason alone is why this should be a must see collectors item.
The brothers appear to realistically portray the process of becoming a NYC firefighter.
Life and death hang in the balance.
They were probably added just to attract more television viewers.
Nonpareil portrayals of raw human emotion and drama.
5 out of 10.
The effect would be greater.
I'm reading the books now.
Anyone not moved by this television show is immune to anything.
My roommate had bought this documentary and invited me to watch it with her.
But I do not think we thought about what they were really going though.
They heard the bodies collapsing on the ground from people jumping out the windows.
May God bless their kind and brave hearts.
She got to see the truth of what had happened that tragic day.
No one expected this to happen.
How wrong I was.
You can not duplicate this.
A great piece of work.
A thin story with many fine shots.
You can see his humor in all his movies.
I love Monte Carlo and thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
I thought everyone was very good.
George Hamilton was charming and the perfect Italian gigolo.
James Belushi is hysterical as a total jerk.
Cybill Shepard gave a very sweet performance as a nice vulnerable ignored housewife.
Just a nice pick me up for a dreary day.
I Spent 5 Years searching for it.
Because his characters are loved and ask to be loved.
But he succeeds in making a good product.
It has an interesting plot complete with lovable characters.
The three main actors.
The show was hilarious to say the least.
Simple and complex jokes that could appeal to all ages.
Running jokes throughout the series that could spawn a drinking game.
I enjoyed this movie.
It is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric.
I saw that when I was little and it was excellent.
I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one that loved this movie.
we would watch it all the time.
Big rock candy mountain is amazing.
it is so fuzzy and colorful that i dream about it at night.
i recommend that people of all ages watch this movie.
we are going to order pizza and watch the teddy bears giggle.
This show teaches good lessons about imagination and getting along well with others.
Some parts I found quite entertaining.
I would recommend this.
Chuck Norris have many plans for the future .
Good marshal arts acting.
Perhaps the writer should actually WATCH the movie before attempting to comment on it.
I have always enjoyed seeing Chuck Norris in film.
I also enjoyed seeing Judson Mills perform along side him.
The movie was very similar to the events of Sept.
It has a lot of adventure in it.
You will not be disappointed with either one.
A time when it was in to be a swinger.
Not much more to it.
Anna is always eating but must have incredible metabolism.
50 CAN a month you can spend.
Lars Von Triers Europa is an extremely good film.
The final scene is one of the most harrowing scenes ever.
This movie is far better than the original The Jerk.
I would highly recommend it to anyone who like quirky humor.
The card game with the hobos and then with Mr.
The scene at the dinner table and his distaste for turtle soup.
The original The Jerk was too choreographed ans staged.
The Jerk Too is a spoof and will be enjoyed by anyone.
The Jerk Too is family friendly unlike the original The Jerk.
taking nothing away from Marty.
I wish I could get a copy of it for my collection.
I urge you to see it if you can find it.
I'm on the opposite end of the previous comment.
I say give this movie some credit.
It does have plenty of laughs in it.
I do not understand.
My confusion lies with the content.
303 Brownings in a dorsal turret.
Really loved the cinematography and direction.
Pace was just right and the portrayals of nearly all characters was impressive.
and I have yet to see Gladiator.
Everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected.
I replay their scenes over and over again.
Anyone who has ever been in love will empathize with these people.
All characters are cast and portrayed excellently.
I have watched this movie numerous times and it always makes me laugh.
Very nicely done movie.
It does stay in your memory.
He is good and exudes charm.
I'm glad it allowed as I have heard the sequels are equally outrageous.
Everyone involved in this film clearly had a lot of fun making it.
For entertainment value I found this movie to be both engaging and repugnant.
They depict the seats of government as being like a revivalist Baptist church.
It is really well done and very entertaining.
It clearly marks a moment in time for our collective consciousness.
the guts and entrails were actually very convincing.
very good for a laugh.
But It was a great mystery that can happen to anyone of us.
i found this movie really great and scary.
and the mind is a powerful thing.
i recommend to watch this movie.
for those who rate it a 1.
they do not understand the film.
and how bad the ocean life can be for each and everyone of us.
One of the great classic comedies.
This is THE spoiler.
We do not see that she is alone.
The girl is saved by a crew in a helicopter and another boat.
But I closed my eyes.
The other role that sticks in my mind is that of William Conrad.
I would never see or heard of him before this film.
Conrad plays a terrific part in this film.
It seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth.
Only Phyllis Kirk has any feeling for him.
They humiliate Sinatra and run him out of town.
Pity for some reason this has not been seen for years.
Bill is an excellent actor and would love to see him in more films.
It was a wonderful ensemble performance from all concerned.
i have seen it 3 times so far.
I watched the movie in a preview and I really loved it.
The cast is excellent and the plot is sometimes absolutely hilarious.
Post WWII life is simply and idyllically portrayed.
Art Direction and Editing are way above par.
I enjoyed Still Crazy more than any film I have seen in years.
The concert at the end was unreal.
You have to watch it.
Once again great movie.
I suppose it is fitting that this was his last film.
4 out of 10.
I love this movie.
I would like to see more movies like this.
And when you get to the final scene.
I thought this movie was fantastic.
Kinda reminded me of Spinal Tap.
You will not regret seeing this movie.
I know I do not.
Bruce Robinson was awesome.
Helena was a lovely girlfriend.
The point is this movie deserves repeated viewings.
He has an appealing hangdog look that makes women want to hug him.
But all the actors are equally brilliant.
Ignore any pans you read about this movie and see it.
Another example of the unique talents of Cary Grant.
So I rented it.
And that is not bad at all.
He sets off in search of the other members of the band.
Somewhat reluctantly the band agree to give the reunion a try.
But he wants them to start touring again first.
And so they hit the club circuit around Europe.
It is on tour that the film really starts to develop.
And they rediscover some of the interpersonal chemistry that made playing together so enjoyable.
Guess I will have to rent that next.
She loves the song so much now.
A triple whammy there.
The soundtrack is excellent.
All Grant can do is moan.
A classic movie that is really a treasure.
Far much better than Spinal Tap for instance.
They want to catch up with their crazy youth they miss so much.
Like anyone of us.
It was just another movie I watched partly on TV.
Then on several film posters and the film script.
A story about men getting along with each other.
It contains some of the best actors possible.
I'm addicted to this film.
I'm addicted to Strange Fruit.
This movie is tremendous for uplifting the Spirits.
The soundtrack is unbelievable.
Each member of Fruit are quite memorable.
The lifestyle depicted was remarkable in itself.
This was the first time I saw real people using cordless phones.
at the time anyway.
BTW I am a married man.
One of the Hong Kong Films of the year.
Strongly recommended to all Asian films lovers.
The ending is surprising but thoroughly consistent and believable.
Election does have some faults with the majority coming in the opening third.
Where Election really soars is its attention to that fine detail.
Simon Yam was my favorite character here and sort of anchors the picture.
Both films are gangster epics that are similar in form.
And while Election is an enjoyable piece of cinema.
it is just not nearly as good as it is sequel.
This has disastrous results and heads the triads into an all out war.
Much of the film is devoted to the recovery of the Baton.
Fans of the gangster genre are likely to appreciate it in that aspect.
This is dark and grim.
The pacing is relatively slow and deliberate.
People just randomly do things regardless of how their personalities were set up prior.
The performances are reasonably amusing and colorful.
Big D will change his tune or.
Another good watch would be Dragon Squad.
Election marks the 2nd trial society theme movie directed by Johnnie To.
Election has hardly failed any critics who wants an different trial society theme movie.
This film really deserves more recognition than its getting.
And a scream or two.
I was really excited about seeing this film.
I thought finally Australia had made a good film.
but I was wrong.
This was the most pathetic attempt at a slasher film ever.
I was expecting a big surprise about who the killer was.
which turned this realistic slasher film into an awful horror movie.
It was the first time I have seen a theatrically release Australian slasher flick.
I thought that the movie was pretty good.
mostly everything in UL final cut needed to be improved.
The best part of CUT is the killer and the death scenes.
i give cut a 8 out of 10.
There is so much to love in this darling little comedy.
It falls somewhere in the middle.
None of these comments are relevant.
Probably a bit of both.
This is not a bad movie.
So this might be an example of what the genre has become.
I liked it I gave it an eight.
The Direction is good.
Jessica Napier is cute and does fine as the other heroine.
Rest of the cast are fine.
however there are some good positives in this film.
there are a few concerns about this movie.
i enjoyed it and had some fun.
Suspenseful Australian slasher flick with very few scares.
Really bad slasher flicks.
But that is par for the course.
The director tells off the killer in front of the cast and crew.
He goes crazy and kills two people.
People who try and finish it are killed themselves.
The students ignore that.
No one is great but no one is terrible either.
No great shakes but not bad at all.
I give it a 7.
This is one of those little Christmas movies for everyone.
There really IS something for everyone.
You will have to see the movie if you want to know why.
00 from the total.
This movie is better than 4.
I can see this happening.
wealthy people have done crazier things than this.
And it was funny.
This movie fully suits that purpose.
You can survive Surviving Christmas.
I thought the television version was a bit edited way down.
This movie is definitely a fresh new idea that was pulled off pretty well.
It was a fun and funny movie.
It was a wonderful movie that I will be adding to my Christmas selection.
I rate it right up there with Christmas vacation.
This movie turned out to be one laugh after another.
He then drives the family crazy with overindulgence for Christmas cheer.
Sure you can see where this movie is going but you do not care.
I got what I wanted.
I laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt.
Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd are delightful in this film.
I can not imagine anyone not enjoying this movie completely.
a true feast for the eyes.
It was number 10 on The 100 Greatest TV Treats 2004.
This is probably the best documentary I have seen in a very long time.
Listening to his smart ass remarks and seeing his adorable gestures was heartwarming.
And seeing him smile was indescribable.
I feel blessed to have been able to be touched by this tiny giant.
i was greatly moved when i watched the movie.
i have seen people in tears because of a blemish.
this movie brings everything back to the basics .
it makes our everyday problems seen for what they are Small and really unimportant.
you are truly blessed.
and the saying stop and smell the roses truly has a new meaning.
This man is nothing short of amazing.
The most moving and truly eye opening documentary ever created.
I truly felt for him.
I believe that this should be compulsory viewing in schools.
He was on a crusade to raise money for his cause.
I highly recommend this.
You watch as John lives through the last couple months of his life.
You watch as he goes through his days with a positive attitude.
At one point you begin to see that he is truly an amazing individual.
You begin to understand that he has something to teach all of us.
He became a poet in exile wondering how to change the world.
The wind blows your eyes far away.
But the film still ends on an optimistic note.
The problem was there literally were not enough houses to satisfy the demand.
Bradford in order to solve this very strange murder mystery.
Jean Arthur is quite glamorous in her role and very funny.
Jean Arthur SHINES when she looks at Powell.
There is an unmistakable undercurrent buzzing between them.
My friends thought the same.
They succeeded to some degree.
So by this time he was pretty well set in the role.
This is after he comes to Bill Powell for help.
Myrna Loy was a more steadying influence on Bill Powell than Jean Arthur was.
Arthur plays it as more of a dizzy dame than Loy did.
But it works here and she and Powell have good chemistry.
Good but not great.
In a way I feel it could have been that bit better.
The Five Deadly Venoms is easily the most memorable K.
This movie launched the careers of the five men who play the venoms.
He would go on to be in Super Ninjas.
I loved this film.
The comedy is well played by all involved.
Talent ran in that family.
I recall seeing this movie as a kid.
I do not recall where I saw it.
I must have been around 14 years old.
I thought the movie was incredible and wished to see it again.
I was really bummed.
The fights were very short and few and far between.
The fighting is all pretty routine.
I remember lots of them.
I remember the day clearly.
Me and my dad had just gotten lunch at Burger King.
Then under that was the Title of the film.
It said Five Deadly Venoms.
Then the movie began.
I loved this movie the minute it came on.
My favorite character was the Toad Venom.
it was the fighting.
The fights were so.
This movie is really good.
Fighting scenes are very good.
The only thing which may be irritating is actors look.
I really like this movie.
I can watch it on a regular basis and not tire of it.
I suppose that is one of my criteria for a great movie.
The story is very interesting.
We also get to see the venoms fight each other in every combination.
It is fun to see how their styles match up against each other.
See this one at all costs.
This film is breath of fresh air in comparison.
Around 7 out of 10.
Then again he might not have.
Lead players Cary Grant and Myrna Loy plays Mr.
Thus a simple plot becomes almost a suspense thriller.
But what really solidifies the movie are the venoms themselves.
Five men trained by the same master in different ways and wearing masks.
Its more about the intrigue of the story and the characters that are involved.
Very well made with a unique story.
Be careful with this one.
We learn along with him.
I can not say enough about the choreography or the camera work.
But this one does several things well.
Much more clever stuff than what we usually get out of this genre.
Still though this movie is one of Shaw Brothers best and is quite enjoyable.
8 out of 10 on the scale.
Such level of skill amongst the cast is unsurpassed in modern day cinema.
However the plot certainly is better than average.
I always enjoy this movie when it shows up on TV.
This makes some of the scenes in the movie much more effective.
We actually care when people are killed in this film.
Some of the sequences in this movie are truly gut wrenching.
When characters go in search of vengeance you really feel their anger and pain.
all this just adds to the greatness of the film.
The lighting and composition are spectacular at times.
He is an important filmmaker who continues to influence many people.
The thought of Sarah Silverman having her own show worried me at first.
The one downfall of this show is its supporting cast.
A VERY good chance from the usual comedy out there.
The Sarah Silverman program is .
better than those other shows.
The Sarah Silverman program.
Go watch and see.
Best show since Seinfeld.
One of the few shows I make point of watching.
It gets flat very fast.
Give it a shot.
It has that same flow and that same rhythm.
Melvin Douglas is especially brilliant.
The best kind of comedy around.
Nothing that appears on T.
show for there to be mistakes.
This show is stupid because Sarah wanted it to be stupid.
This show is juvenile because Sarah wanted it to be juvenile.
The cast is awesome.
I'm sure they are wonderful bright people that operate at a different wavelength.
Therefore I always fast before watching it and wear adult diapers.
I'm a happy guy.
This is like Grease meets South Park.
Sarah Silverman is someone I could watch reading the phone book.
Her delivery is precise and oh so funny.
She never skips a beat.
It seemed to be a genuine question.
Sarah can come at you from odd angles.
God being petty and jealous added wonderfully to the joke.
What I also love is that not everything is a punchline.
Instead the Sarah Silverman Program makes it more realistic in this sense.
This show probably will not appeal to everyone.
Everyone should at least give this show a chance.
This kind of stuff is the future of entertainment.
I watch this show and I laugh a very large percentage of the time.
I can not say that about many TV shows.
You owe it to yourself to watch this show.
I predict a long run for this series.
perhaps they lack the intelligence to comprehend it.
they should stop making fools of themselves by attacking something they do not understand.
is way off the mark.
If you are thinking of building see this movie first.
The dollar amounts may have changed but everything else is the same.
This film was done after that rescue.
One of the best love stories I have ever seen.
Then I got to looking at their body of work.
Grey Gardens sounded very interesting.
She seems to have a nervous disorder of some kind.
Worrying too much about things.
It is a 28 room mansion that is worn down and worn out.
The outfits Edie comes up with a very clever and creative.
Edie too was a beauty in her day and quite attractive at 56.
This movie is hard to come by.
This as well makes it clear that it is not exploitation.
And both Edith and Edie just love the idea of being filmed.
Exhibit all their artistic skills in front of their camera.
Little Edie and Big Edie are characters that anyone can feel compassion for.
Grey Gardens is a world unto itself.
I was awed at how beautiful and raw this documentary was.
It is a sincere look into the unedited reality of a life of solitude.
really no words can describe.
The move Grey Gardens is beyond bizarre.
Both of them remain beautiful despite their encroaching age.
I first saw this film in 1980 in the midday movie spot.
It becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are well past eccentric.
The content is pretty much made up of two things.
The second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties.
Their hopes and dreams as decayed as the mansion they live in.
Despite their bickering these two need each other more than ever.
For without the other there would be no refuge from the loneliness.
Her response to a complaint about the smell is simply unbelievable.
bickered and performed while reminiscing of their past.
This is a film you will not soon forget.
I fell in love with this film and with the characters in it.
It has an air of sadness that permeates throughout.
A fall from greatness for this once esteemed family.
Excellent film showing the pathetic lives of two nutty old ladies.
I got to get to a hotel room.
he just gave us a washing machine.
raccoons and cats become a little bit boring for too long a time.
yes the pleasure is all mine.
bring me my little radio I have got to have some professional music.
It is she who will have the last laugh maybe.
Well worth your time.
This movie has more to recommend it than I can put down into words.
It is a rare experience that you must see for yourself.
And of course there are numerous cats running around.
As for the house itself.
It stars two spellbinding characters in what is unfortunately a mediocre documentary.
What a strange film.
have chosen to document.
Little Edie is even more interesting.
One of the better documentaries ever made and still a cult classic today.
The once beautiful gardens are now a jungle.
Clothing is seems to be optional.
There is a constant undercurrent of sexual tension.
Ice cream spread on crackers.
Edie feels like Edith thwarted any of her attempts at happiness.
Sometimes it is difficult to hear exactly what is being said.
Both women talk at the same time and constantly contradict each other.
This is a difficult film to watch but well worth the effort.
Renting Cypher was like a punt on a possibly very lame horse.
It must have been very quiet or I just missed it.
In any case the affects are secondary.
I will not give anything away about the plot.
Just give it a chance.
The character development is intentionally shallow.
Just a genius perfect combination for such a movie.
The viewer has to WATCH him and Think as this story unfolds.
Just go somewhere and secretly record and transmit inside data.
Take it from there.
Then it begins to accelerate.
I do not recommend that to anyone.
I'm not gonna say what cause that will spoil the hole movie.
I wish would it would never end.
Anyone could have played it.
Kaufman and Moss Hart.
The former was about moving into an 18th Century country house that.
The escalating costs of the project are one matter that bedevils Jim.
To categorize this film into a single genre would be criminal.
This is pure psychology.
Cypher is such a film.
They send him to different parts of America to record different seminars.
Covering topics as mundane as shaving cream and cheese.
And I'm not saying anything more about the plot.
And Cypher follows similar patterns.
But it is not a carbon copy of Cube.
It has it is own inspiration.
One thing that distinguishes Cypher from Cube is how much more polished it is.
The acting is uniformly excellent throughout.
His performance is excellent because it is so modulated.
He literally seems to transform right before our very eyes.
David Hewlett puts in a welcome appearance who made such an impact in Cube.
But Morgan deserves his happy ending.
Cypher succeeds on all counts.
And it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable Matrix.
And now I'm a committed fan of the man.
Cypher is an absolute masterpiece.
I can not overemphasis how phenomenal this movie is.
Cypher is one of the best spy movies ever conceived and ever made.
There is nothing wrong with or cheap about Cypher whatsoever.
This is not a spoiler.
Cypher is counterespionage at it is absolute best.
Hands down and hats off.
Nothing is what it seems and truth is stranger than fiction.
The future is now.
My vote is eight.
The conferences are all covers to allow the company men to brainwash their spies.
The cast are great.
The rest of the cast are also good.
He paces the film superbly as well and has given it a great look.
The efforts of the director and the actors combined in an effective thriller.
Grant has always been a favorite of mine in this type of role.
He is so good at playing the put upon husband.
Loy is a always a joy to watch.
The Thin Man films she made with William Powell are near perfect.
And that is where the comedy comes in.
But to say Cypher is a clone would be to its discredit.
This is not helped by a strange woman who turns up.
I guess given the time of production it was a mix of all three.
Admittedly the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable.
We were able to witness what appeared to be realistic training regimens and equipment.
Where this movie came together for me was closer to the end.
Stallone is Gabe Walker.
Cat and Mouse on the mountains with ruthless terrorists.
Stallone needed this role to get back on track.
The is placed in beautiful place and it is very exciting movie.
Another weak point was the unrealistic shooting scenes.
This movie had a lot of all time great potential.
Sill a good movie though.
I know I did.
The only caveat is that social attitudes have changed a lot since 1948.
Eight months has passed.
This was one of the biggest hits of 1993.
Stallone certainly made an short comeback of this sharp thriller.
Do not miss this great action film.
Based on a premise by John Long.
This movie is just great.
In my opinion this movie is highly underrated by the critics.
For the sake of the film though I willing to suspend my disbelief.
The deaths are inventive while others are sort of predictable.
This is the rhythm of the film in a nutshell.
You would better be.
The old guy who flies the chopper.
I have no idea what drugs he was on when he did it.
Since I first saw this in the theater it has been my favorite.
There has not been a movie I can compare this too.
This is an action movie at it is BEST.
I do not think I will see another that is so entertaining.
And it is particularly good in this movie.
The special effect are great and spectacular.
Stallone really needed that movie get back with success.
This movie was filmed in a magnificent natural environment.
I give it a 6.
My vote is eight.
As a Stallone fan this is one I look back on with fond memories.
Plenty of superb action and Sly in prime action man form.
have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the U.
government somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and they really would like it back.
A showcase of great scenes and stunts.
Quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever.
So that is two points for him before the film even starts.
the desire and need to bring fantasies to reality.
The diary contains magic formulas that supposedly enable prisoners to escape.
9 out of 10.
This is a movie that works best if you are immersed into it.
I was hooked from beginning to end.
The horror you create in your own mind.
but not in the way they imagined.
Now this is what I would call a good horror.
This is a timeless movie for all ages that is sure to please.
Achieving true comedic dialog is an art.
Watched this French horror film last night and pretty much liked it.
I'm glad I had a chance to watch this film.
The gore is a product of what the book unleashes.
My vote is seven.
The kills are raw and eerie.
I just wish the story had led to a more consistent finale.
We are inside a ramshackle French prison cell with four occupants.
It is an unholy alloy of triumphs and failures.
The characters are intriguing.
It has a real life ring to it.
That really is the problem with an obsession with understanding and knowledge.
Lensed well in 1.
The characters are superbly developed and the cast makes the most of them.
I think that was the Golden Age of English series.
They all shared equal screen time and all had their moments to shine.
the bluest eyes you would probably see on TV.
I have also followed Bill Gaunts career with interest since.
We absolutely adored it.
Hopefully it will find a new generation of fans.
Who I thought was beautiful and intelligent.
I was 10 years old when this show was on TV.
By far it was my favorite.
The actors were very credible.
There was a good story in each episode.
I highly recommend this TV show to anybody that like good stuff.
the thought that maybe they will not get together.
the dancing on the side of the road scene was magnificent.
except for maybe the fact that she is psycho.
Manhattan apartment dwellers have to put up with all kinds of inconveniences.
This is only the beginning of his problems.
The film is fun because of the three principals in it.
The direction of H.
This movie is wonderful.
Very witty and clever script.
The scenes are alive with fresh energy and really talented production.
It was nice to see Ally again.
She is one of my all time favorite movie actors.
I laughed and cried as the story unfolded.
Great story and cast.
Alice Drummond is Wise And Wonderful as Stella.
The roadside dance scene is brilliant.
Really liked this one.
This movie only confirms what was clear from that movie.
This comedy with much underlying pain and sadness succeeds where most others fail.
So was the case with most of the reviewers.
THOSE WHO THINK AND WRITE.
THOSE WRITE AND MAKE THE READERS THINK.
We share an addiction.
We are approval junkies.
I was very surprised to see the overall rating as 5.
This film is special.
I'm giving ten out of ten it is one of the best movies ever.
it is all very simple.
I have never known of a film to arouse such debate in my life.
I absolutely loved this film and i can not wait to see it again.
I saw the gala the other night and this movie definitely split the audience.
However there were many good things too.
well you have to see it.
I watched to movie today and it just blew my mind away.
Another thing I really liked about this film is how damn beautiful it is.
If you see it you will know what I mean.
watch it with an open mind and you may enjoy it.
And that is my 2 cents.
They do not expect him to explore new frontiers.
So this movie toys with your head.
This movie is different than Snatch.
but that is the shoddiest reason to disregard a piece of art.
Funny people can be thoughtful too.
I am still searching for some copy of the gorgeous soundtrack.
The excellent soundtrack compliments the film well.
I have been looking for this movie for so many years.
I saw this move when I was nine and loved this movie.
I called Disney all the movie stores and the net.
What a waste it was a very good movie.
The beginning was great and I remember becoming very attached to the little foxes.
This movie made me cry for hours.
It was a good movie.
She unknowingly walks into a foot trap.
He alone has to teach them the skills they need for life.
I felt emotionally gutted after seeing all this evil going on.
I was moved to tears.
Or they fall victims to tragedy themselves.
Best all around soundtrack and musical score I have ever heard.
And then there is the aftermath of what happened.
Guess you can make up your own mind about the true ending.
I'm left feeling that only one character should have survived at the end.
This film made John Glover a star.
And I mean that sport.
Maybe it is me.
A very strong and satisfying little number that is well worth checking out.
Three blackmailers leech onto him.
It also felt like a movie that took some cuts.
The actors involved give some of their finest performances.
Anyone who likes action combined with a gritty complicated story will enjoy this.
This slick and gritty film consistently delivers.
To call this film sleazy would be a huge understatement.
I do not know why I love this movie so much.
Just thinking about his voice is enough to make me chuckle.
Plenty of cameos by real life porno stars.
9 of 10 stars.
he died by getting shot in the eye.
This was the best and well orchestrated scene ever in the Sopranos.
But his legacy will live on forever.
Chase has created a true phenomenon with The Sopranos.
There is real skill here.
I simply love the beauty of the picture.
This is my favorite show.
I think it is utterly brilliant.
Thanks to David Chase for bringing this into my life.
the cast was excellent.
Long live the Sopranos and Tony Soprano.
Let me tell u something.
I started watching many T.
Then we have The Sopranos.
The raw emotion he displays is superb.
The story is nothing short of excellent.
Each episode is directed superbly and the Score of this show is just fantastic.
V show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that is The Sopranos.
But everyone is excellent.
And that is just the tip of the iceberg.
on a show and you are already winning points on in my book.
Every character represents a facet of American industry.
I'm sure that people from France would not appreciate the caricatures of the French.
My sides and my jaws were hurting at the end of the movie.
Not everything is perfect however.
It shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems.
A sort of chameleon quality to transcend roles.
She is wise if not wiser and more street savvy then Tony himself.
This in my opinion is the worst thing about the HBO series.
Too much space in between seasons and very sporadic.
This episode deals with my most favorite character of all time in The Sopranos.
He was killed for hijacking the wrong truck and accidentally killing a truck driver.
He was killed on a boat by Tony.
All the awesome characters are dead.
All the cool guys always get killed.
Each season is completely brilliant in its own way.
And it is not just him.
The first two seasons were extraordinary.
Trust me in that it will be well worth the time.
Each character unfolds more and more each series.
Every little detail builds the perfect TV series.
It is the single most genius text in cinematic history.
It can only be taken in portions.
its sort of exploitive.
by now I'm just trying to take up the ten line minimum.
My comment ended a while ago.
Hopefully it works when I submit it now.
The best TV ever.
A tip of the pork pie to Mr.
These guys were definitely the best of their generations and even more.
We have been totally spoiled now.
The argument of both are splendid and the actors are perfect.
Congratulations for such a work.
Sorry about my English.
It has so much more.
Many of the issues we see on the show are very real.
Watching this show you will find yourself realizing that these characters are NOT real.
This show is also very versatile.
Overall this is a masterpiece of a show.
This is what television should be.
The Sopranos is arguably the greatest show in Dramatic Television history.
The series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitous.
I want to make some comments about the movie itself.
First I would like to say how great this.
It is astounding and sometimes shocking.
It is like a trip through humanity.
Its stark realism shows through this monumental masterpiece.
From MIDNIGHT COWBOY we get a stark and sometimes disturbing urban view on life.
You do not have to steal it.
Nor is the script anywhere close to a Woody Allen or Mel Brooks.
The script is heavily but not obnoxiously aware that this is just a movie.
I think it was a brilliant decision by Hoffman to take this role.
Otherwise he may have been typecast after the Graduate.
Joe is shook up by a haunting childhood.
He has a strong fear and hatred of religion due to his traumatic baptism.
They go out and work together in helping each other out.
The two grow remarkably close and soon can not live without each other.
This is one of the greatest films ever made.
The difference is that this film is from their perspective.
and am not the least bit ashamed.
They smell no less sweet because they are of a different hue.
He gave them superbly.
Wayne got his Oscar.
if you can get in.
and are admired for it.
I get heartbroken for both.
Its both artistically valid yet entirely accessible and commercial.
No wonder it was a huge success when initially released.
The direction by John Schlesinger makes the material work.
It combines a simplistic style with some experimental editing.
Its still as powerful now as it was when initially released.
The acting however is what makes this a masterpiece.
The two eventually forge a bond that is both touching and pathetic.
He is so into character that all else around him pales in comparison.
Midnight Cowboy is not for everybody.
He does not apologize for his chosen profession but it is not that easy.
The film became famous and infamous almost overnight.
Very compelling and sensationally creative film that I highly recommend.
Saw this as a young naive punk when it was first released.
Thankfully this time I was at home.
This is one hell of a great movie.
His subconscious mirrors the way in which his real life is panning out.
They begin sharing everything in life.
It does not work out as he planned.
They live in an empty and very filthy apartment.
The editing in this movie is great.
Especially Hoffman delivers some fine famous lines.
The score is done by John Barry and sounds great.
At the time I recall being quite startled and amused by this movie.
Bernhard has an unusually perceptive behavioral notebook.
Nina Simone comes to mind.
The movie is quite long at two hours but never really seems very long.
I was pleasantly surprised.
What makes the film interesting is the two characters are so different.
I personally think the film beautifully and poignantly explores its main themes.
The religious connotations in the film are also puzzling.
Midnight cowboy should be required viewing at all film schools.
I recommend this film to everyone.
I'm giving it a 10.
But this one I can live with.
There are usually some pretty funny comics selected through.
when other comics clearly should have beaten them out.
This is where imagination wins out over fact.
Cordell is a recent widow and it is unclear how his wife died.
Her face is bloodied and her eyes are closed.
There are a few scenes that hint of incestuous possibilities.
He never really looks like he can be trusted in this film.
The Incubus is a well done film.
And bitter pills are always more difficult to swallow than sweet ones.
It also carries a kind of Gothic vibe as well.
Nice filming locations and some stylish camera work also highlight.
This is a wonderful film.
Perhaps a revival is just down the pipeline.
This is truly the greatest Swedish movie of all time.
It all creates a very vivid picture of a life that is long gone.
Exploding cigars provide a running gag.
A minor but admirable little film.
The very first shot might be startling.
It certainly adds to the gritty flavor of the atmosphere.
And he has a soft spot for ornery orphan Cooper.
this is not Steven kings best work.
i thought that his best work was the shining.
as if that person can do a better job in making a horror flick.
i mean making the gage evil and how he kills Jud is genius.
making the most innocent most unsuspecting character into one of the killers is cool.
i still recommend people to watch the movie.
The movie does skip far ahead and does miss some important parts.
First of all the plot is truly original and one of a kind.
The acting is also great and i love the cast.
Probably the most accurate Stephen King adaption yet.
The story follows the Creed family moving into a beautiful Maine house.
Maybe he was buried alive.
Nothing more I can say without ruining the story.
The characters are real and the situations are normal.
Mary Lambert does a great job directing the proceedings.
The scene where Gage is killed will stick in your mind forever.
Non Horror fans will want to avoid this.
This really captures the heart of the book.
Fred Gwynne is WONDERFUL.
THE ATMOSPHERE OF THIS FILM IS CERTAINLY A NOVELTY AND ONE OF A KIND.
this one is way beyond compare in intelligence compared to that stuff.
The acting is actually first rate for a film like this.
And the results are horrifying.
Highly recommended for genre fans.
5 out of 10.
A classic now and truly a must see for any Horror fan.
You will not regret.
But that is just my opinion.
Baby Gage was amazing even on his creepy parts.
Something is for sure.
Bernhard is a little of these influential entertainers and more.
Since Louis is a veterinarian and has a young toddler for a son.
And that third act.
One of the better Stephen King adaptations I would say.
And that is where the real horror story begins.
I personally find this movie very good.
and what is better than the dead coming to life.
and something about animals returning from the grave is quite creepy too.
and most important to me .
it stuck true with the novel.
They are greeted with kindness by Jud Crandall.
That is the start of hell for the Creed family.
The music in this movie plays an extravagant part.
It is at the same time sad and mysterious.
It goes along with the movie wonderfully.
But there is a pet cemetery behind their house.
That burial ground is pure evil.
There is one character in this film that is truly freaky.
This is truly one of most favorite horror films of all time.
10 out of 10.
I kind of liked The Lonely Lady.
Give Pia a break.
She looks great and she has really nice eyes.
But its a trashy movie.
A lot of movies that are trashy are not all bad.
Pia gets naked a lot and seems miscast as a writer.
A couple of the scenes are funny.
I want to see someone do that speech in a drama class.
You could find worse on any movie of the week back in the eighties.
This is an excellent film that will not disappoint you.
Hitchcock displays his already developed understanding for visuals in this early silent film.
Nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols.
The film also gives insight into his later treatment of women.
upscale supper clubs like the Parisian Room.
The scene in the club throughout the movie is dryer than a bone.
It may not be meant to be funny across the board.
Perhaps it is a bit unsettling or even maudlin for some.
A beautiful painting about love and death.
This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
This is a much more impressive film than its present obscurity would suggest.
Surprisingly good early effort from Alfred Hitchcock.
The Ring really deserves more recognition than the inferior but better known The Lodger.
One sequence remains in my memory to this day.
and for a few seconds there it is.
has gone and it is time for the spacecraft to return to Earth.
This documentary was nominated for an Oscar and it is easy to see why.
Good use of live footage and animation in tandem.
I remember these shows when they were first broadcast on Disneyland.
That was fifty years ago.
Turn around and you are a young wife with babes of your own.
you are wondering how much has really changed in 50 years.
A recommended film which was the first for Jim Henson Productions.
She was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had lots of extracurricular money.
Trudy also raised two chimps in her home to be more like children.
They dressed in clothes and had many amenities.
Rene Russo plays her role wonderfully feminine.
And that is what happens.
A speed boat is no match to our busy beaver on the river.
We also know when he is going to be wounded.
It is the forbidden or the restricted that is attractive.
My heart goes out to them.
The story is extremely unique.
The ending COULD have been fantastic.
The animation is decent for 89 but can not compare to nowadays.
I have also heard many complain about the cheesiness of the nudity.
I actually found it to be somewhat decent.
Overall it deserves a look but the ending keeps it from being a classic.
There are no loops and sequences in which the art decreases in quality.
The last episode was entirely done in black and white.
The music is very typical space opera fair.
Neither aspect is ever left completely out though.
But it is done exceptionally well for a change.
It will grow on you.
There are a few surprises.
And the music is OUT OF THIS WORLD.
playing bar room characters in both.
He shows finely nuanced performances .
the good and the bad in his characters.
making love to an actress you kinda grew up with.
What a surprisingly good movie this one turned out to be.
This is the type of film that I have been looking for ages.
Star Trek Hidden Frontier will surprise you in many ways.
We can get by that.
Better than almost anything you have seen.
It takes a lot of effort to put on a production of this magnitude.
I highly recommend taking the time to down load and watch.
This is short and to the point.
I will not rehash what has already been said about the sets and graphics.
Congratulations to the cast and crew for an effort that many admire.
BUT BUT the idea of two guys kissing makes me wind forward the episode.
For a fan series this is good stuff.
The local sheriff is behind the crime and the nightmare begins.
Especially the second murder is pretty grim.
7 out of 10.
The ships are rendered well and the space battles are impressive and exciting.
Musically it is a mixed bag.
The episodes are character driven and the characters develop over many episodes.
Hidden Frontier takes taboos that even the official series has shrunk from using.
All in all I enjoyed watching it.
God Bless you all.
This film predates these shows though the effect seems the same.
You potential stars of tomorrow.
There was not quite enough action for me I must say.
The film portrayed the life of a traitor.
He has no real love or loyalty in him.
Heavy psychological stuff and not many light moments in the 6 hour series.
Very well done though.
It had a gritty authenticity and rang true in every way.
The rest of the supporting is excellent as well.
The production values of the miniseries are strong as well.
Yet the highlight of the miniseries is really the script.
This is my second time through for A Perfect Spy.
I watched it 2 or 3 years ago and liked it.
I like it still.
Throughout the story he betrays and is betrayed.
Another theme is that of malignancy.
I really enjoyed it in the end.
Peter Egan is fascinating to watch because his face changes with every camera angle.
But this is a minor and unimportant seam in the whole.
Jane Booker is annoying as Mary Pym.
The British view of Americans is vividly rendered in some dryly hilarious scenes.
The humor and sadness are subtly blended.
It is an accurate reflection of the period in which it is set.
Betrayal is the key by everybody for the good of nobody.
Pym upbringing is so close to my own that I find it chilling watching.
Because there is a good story around the naked rituals and sex scenes.
She exuded massive quantities of sexuality throughout the film.
One wishes they made more movies like this one.
Strongly recommended for fans of international cinema.
And there are some very interesting candles and uses for them.
This masterpiece of lesbian horror comes from exploitation master Joseph W.
but they may not be as helpless as they seem.
this was one of the funniest and informative shows that I have ever seen.
This is a MUST see for anyone over the age of 16.
this show had me and my 2 boys laughing out loud from the beginning.
I agree with the idea of making this a HBO series.
It would have an amazing following.
But after seeing it I realized what a funny man he is.
but some other parts of the world.
I enjoyed how Mr.
But it quickly sucked me in.
I would love to see this picked up as a series for HBO.
He covers fallacies of history and truths that are no longer generally known.
I would like to see much more of this show.
It is very entertaining.
It is well worth your time.
only we soon discover both men have hidden intentions.
My interest was raised as I was flipping through and saw the name Iphigenia.
I am so glad I stayed on the channel.
She is visually stunning.
This is a great film.
There is the uncomfortable racism which is depicted.
But it is everything you could want in a movie.
Now I have seen it.
The parts themselves are often very good and the action sequences are great.
She insists Tarzan to carry a bracelet who belonged to her father.
Well it is supposed to proof Tarzan is dead.
The caravan is leaving and Jane go along.
She could be smart.
If she get home to England without have done this she would become miserable.
Jane is smart but cheap drama brings her down.
Just lean back and enjoy.
John Dillinger escapes from prison and robs a bank in Iowa.
I got a huge kick out of this movie.
The chemistry between Johnny and Maureen is irresistible.
See it for yourself if you do not believe me.
I love Maureen O'Sullivan most of all in this film.
She totally has the ape man at her every beck and call.
Eventually Tarzan and Jane show up and everyone is off on even more adventures.
Its an amazing film by almost any standard.
Its an amazing thing.
I really like this film a great deal.
However on almost every other level this film is top notch.
You really owe it to yourself to see this.
This is one of the great adventures.
There is NO mistake about that at all.
I thought the script was really well thought out and written tightly.
One final word about nudity.
that is the way colored people were thought of and portrayed back then.
Safaris actually did use natives carrying luggage on their heads.
I'm not making this up.
She and Tarzan are shown waking up one morning in their treetop shelter.
Savage Tarzan is innocently sexy.
Another reason why the hung up regarded this film as sinful.
They want Tarzan to guide them to said graveyard.
It is Jane who maintains her cool.
So there you have it.
An utterly subversive film.
Tarzan and Jane are living happily in the jungle.
Some men come looking for ivory and to take Jane back to civilization.
But Jane loves Tarzan and refuses to leave.
even if that means killing Tarzan.
This one has MUCH better effects and is a lot more adult.
Everybody else is OK.
The first of the Tarzan movies staring Johnny Weissmuller.
The plot has already been summarized so i wont go into it again.
you are missing a Real treat.
no one will ever play Tarzan as well as Johnny Weissmuller did.
He was and is Tarzan.
He climbs a hill to tell Iphigenia that he will protect her.
It is a sharp and sad epiphany that lasts only for an instant.
Forrester Harvey and Nathan Curry round out a small cast very professionally.
The crisp display of later Tarzan films is lacking here.
Later she admits to Tarzan that she was wrong.
This to me is very much at the core of the Tarzan experience.
I would recommend this movie strongly to anyone.
The movie can never decide whether we should like him or hate him.
Tarzan kills lions and rhinos and a steadily increasing number of animals.
They still do not need to talk a lot.
They sleep together and hang out with cool animals and stay away from cities.
No wonder they are happy.
The skin show in this film is off the charts.
As noted by other reviewers this is one of the best Tarzan movies.
The only things missing are color and stereo sound.
Her outfit showed what a great figure Maureen O'Sullivan possessed.
There is plenty of action in here.
Maureen O'Sullivan is charming and beautiful as Jane and walks off with the movie.
But a savage tribe and hideous torture await the group.
com if you know where I can buy a copy.
We watched it last night for the first time.
I was also impressed at how true it was to the play.
The catalog is around here someplace.
This movie gets it right.
The tedium of the application process.
The waiting for word.
The joy of acceptance.
The worry about making it through the course.
The glory of graduation.
Many are called but few are chosen.
We did for pay what we would have eagerly paid to do.
I had a personal interest in this movie.
for one or two weeks.
The three central characters in this movie are really pretty ugly people.
This is the longest version of the story and goes deeply into characterization.
Its also a lot more sexual than the Lana Turner version.
We have a very obvious adulterous relationship and Giovanna is very obviously a nymphomaniac.
This is a far greater study of the working class than of crime.
The audience really gets the feeling of poverty and grime.
I think the casting was brilliant for this film.
My only beef is with the overlong running time.
The harshness of the landscape is particularly fitting to the souls of the characters.
Irene Papas is the modern quintessence of classic Greek plays.
It teaches us much about ourselves as individuals and as social and political creatures.
Another conflict raised in the film is that between the Church and the State.
It relies more upon depicting reality in a very grim and sober light.
To say the least it was probably a bit alarming.
I think this is a very satisfying ending for several reasons.
The movie could had easily ended 15 minutes earlier.
it occurs that it is not.
They range from tasteful erotic images to purely technical shots.
His desires show him totally different direction.
They are both very convincing.
But in contrast to Giovanna he questions the committed crime on a moral level.
But then the last sequences make this carefully built construct of ideas collapse.
they keep coming up with films Ive never heard of .
the Italian version of The Postman Always Rings Twice.
This Italian version is different .
more realistic and with a very different ending.
see it watch it.
street scenes and lifestyle glimpses alone are worth watching.
This masterpiece ends in a tragic way.
My vote is ten.
Giovanna is one of the best creations in Ms.
The last sequence of the film shows Ms.
Finally Gino has steady employment.
The acting and direction were both uniformly good throughout.
The two novellas seem like they must be very similar.
Gino is very unenthusiastic about this idea.
Their relationship quickly crumbles.
This is a really fun movie.
But this is where the resemblance stops.
Seriously pushed forward the theme of the last episode even more.
I have to agree with everyone else that has posted.
He does have a cool character.
The guy who finds it necessary to howl.
The hour long chase at the end involving the teacher and the priest.
This movie is great.
Great characters and great lines.
Sally Field is so over the top.
this is what I love about good comedies.
I would love to know how the idea for this movie came up.
He passes by without a word.
And then only too little and too late.
The film chronicles his efforts at finding out more about the woman.
He pieces more and more of her life together.
He has to make things right.
I'm tired of the same old stuff in movies.
I'm tired of the same old stuff in movies.
I'm tired of the same old stuff in movies.
I highly recommend catching this film.
This is NOT a horror flick.
I really felt for Jake.
Here the film is very successful in getting its theme across.
It was on right after Bay City Rollers.
This show is decidedly low tech.
But kids love this stuff.
This is drama and comedy spread on with a trowel.
This is why I still have nightmares.
A boy leaves on a magical journey to an island.
Not suitable for children.
I grew up with H.
This movie is not limited to children either.
The music in this movie suited Jack Wild and Mama Cass beautifully.
growing up still love it today i am 46 years old.
I absolutely LOVED this movie when I was a kid.
I cried every time I watched it.
I totally identified with the characters.
I loved Jack Wilde.
I can still remember the characters vividly.
The film and its actors won several awards.
I highly recommend it.
Otherwise it would be a perfect 10.
I would recommend not drinking anything that would sting coming out your nose.
This movie was excellent.
This is a graphic movie.
So it is Donald Sutherland who walks away with the picture.
Those who speak Hungarian will recognize the many Hungarian accents and credits.
So do some soldiers.
Nor do killers learn regret if they are dead.
I was surprised at how fascinating this movie was.
This is an excellent movie.
Very satisfying and not exploitative about the crimes at all.
He is driven to find and stop the killer.
The locations and sets are perfect recreations of latter day Soviet life.
This is truly a movie that covers several themes simultaneously.
This a film not to be missed.
The photography was good too.
His anguish at not being able to stop the deaths is palpable.
I believe this is the most powerful film HBO Pictures has made to date.
A masterpiece of the genre.
The devotion to duty of the main character was masterfully portrayed by Rea.
You can feel the suffering of the dedicated people who labored in that system.
He murdered 56 people over 8 years in the former Soviet Union.
Rea makes us feel for this man.
All around a very well done movie with fine performances and a great screenplay.
9 out of 10 stars.
HBO has furnished us with an excellent film in an unusual manner.
Congrats to the director and editor of this great piece.
It is in my Top 10 Must see list.
The concept of becoming a serial killer in a communist system is illogical .
But hardly anyone has done it so well.
This is a quality film.
The subject matter is at once grim and gripping.
This is a truly remarkable piece of cinematic achievement.
An HBO product for t.
and it takes place in Russia.
There are only two short action scenes but they are horrific.
There are some excellent comments and observations on this film.
He is the objective.
This is one damn fine film.
This movie tells an amazing story with history and compassion.
Interpol relations and how the agencies work together are also great.
Not overly done either.
How the police work with the political party being what it was.
It is truly fascinating and frustrating.
The settings are beautiful.
HBO has hit the jackpot here.
This film is compelling from the first moment until the last.
They had photos of him sitting in his cage while being prosecuted in court.
This was too good to be made for TV.
I can go either way on material like that.
But the atmosphere of the film is decent.
Merino exploits this fact by incorporating a decent amount of nudity.
I used to pretend to be a bad TV soap actor with my girlfriend.
They do not do that at all in Soap Dish.
Oscar Levant and Leslie Caron I can take or leave.
well it is not really there.
The acting is also not so smooth by Caron.
Few films have so elegantly and succinctly shown two people falling in love.
The film was inspired by the 1928 orchestral composition by George Gershwin.
Gene Kelly directed the brief fantasy dance sequences shown as Lise is introduced.
He used space and time imaginatively.
The ballet in An American in Paris may be his best work.
So Freed went to studio head Louis B.
Well the financial guys finally gave in and signed the checks.
As feel good musicals go it is definitely in the top 10.
An American in Paris is a showcase of Gene Kelly.
The song and dance routines are all perfection.
It won two Academy Awards for Best Picture of 1951 and Best Screenplay.
The story of an American painter in Paris who tries to make it big.
I enjoyed this film.
You can see that MGM was showing off Technicolor.
There are hardly any colors that do not appear in this film.
Every scene is packed full.
The choreography was great.
Gene Kelly is a wonder.
He is so talented.
He understands that the dances can tell the story as much as anything else.
Few American composers have had a better gift for melody.
Ira Gershwin is definitely one of the greatest lyric writers.
He is so witty and charming.
This was a highly entertaining film.
It left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days.
You want the audience to be fully aware of his deficiencies.
But it serves the same function in the plot.
Same with the art show.
I guess it is in the eye of the beholder.
The two films are actually closely linked.
movie after the Ballet ended.
The film literally left me in the lurch.
Gene Kelly came up with some really grand ideas for musicals while with MGM.
Gershwin got the kind of deal for Gershwin music that Irving Berlin normally got.
Two women are interested in him.
At one point Kelly dances on top of the baby grand piano.
So it happened that way.
But this one topped them all.
I guess fantasy trumped realism that year.
Big budgets also have an upper hand in these things as well.
Their romantic love affair sparkles as brightly as the City of Lights itself.
He even applauds to himself as members of the audience.
Kelly seems to defy the boundaries of his physical self.
The film gave us a wealth of memories to take home.
This film is possibly disturbing in many aspects.
Parsifal journeys into the 19th and 20th century throughout the film.
The tempting Flower Maidens are in the nude.
Warner and Nat Pendleton.
Exciting cinematic suspense in both these scenes.
I have been a fan of this movie for years and years.
to name a few.
all give splendid performances.
Must have been a set that was used in many a subsequent film.
Nicely done and passes the time in an entertaining manner.
Van Dine must have been a shrewd businessman in dealing with Hollywood.
Only Tarzan seemed to get around Hollywood more.
MGM produced the Garden Murder Case and starred Edmund Lowe as the fashionable detective.
Mayer decided to concentrate him there.
I will say this though.
A warm family film to enjoy.
It proves that the dreams of an adolescent can truly come true.
A great storyline with a message.
The editing is first rate.
This is a great movie to see with your girlfriend.
We had to get it.
An excellent family movie.
gives a lot to think on.
Everything is just perfect.
The acting is alright.
I first saw this film during and International Film Studies course.
You will still be laughing at it when the disc wears out.
It will reward the attentive and sensitive viewer.
It is a beautifully filmed human story.
The final few scenes are powerful but depressing.
None of the scenes felt gratuitous or out of the place.
Anyone growing up in the South would experience the same things.
Even a glance is forbidden.
There are no words needed.
Their facial expressions say everything.
She really can not see this dance.
They can not even get undressed for bed by themselves.
Their racist attitudes will be erased with their presence.
I think I would like to visit this Africa.
Because there is no real story here.
But I was truly enraptured by its quiet pacing and by the glorious ending.
He says that when he came he wanted to call everyone brother.
This is an amazing film to watch or show young people.
The Whites are all the bosses and they expect Black servitude without question.
till HBO began rerunning it this month.
Cathy Moriarty steals the show in my opinion.
all turn in superb performances as expected.
So 10 it is.
Most students had trouble understanding the end of the film.
The household is divided into public and private spaces.
Personally I liked Greensleeves and the other harsher characters.
They had some of the more amusing lines.
One of the most unheralded great works of animation.
Sorry to disappoint everyone.
I do not watch soaps.
My grandmother still watches that one with the hour glass.
But this movie takes parody and spells it a new way.
I found the story pretty damn funny.
I went and saw Rivers and Tides again today.
To Blake Art was a War.
He would rather have only the images and the wonderful soundtrack.
So I was aware of that as I watched this second time.
Be a Trend setter.
This film is mesmerizing in its beauty and creativity.
This movie is probably for you.
it combines nature and art in a minimal way as it is in itself.
this is overall a great piece of work in every aspect.
it has no boundaries as far as age goes.
This film is stunningly beautiful.
I strongly recommend this movie to everyone.
I can think of nothing else to say about it.
The music set to the film is embracing and intoxicating.
I for one am glad to know that Andy is somewhere out there.
He makes art from objects he finds in nature.
The work seems to be more of a process than a goal.
But do go if you have the opportunity.
There are also several books available with photographs of his sculptures.
It is an experience purely of time and form.
Greetings again from the darkness.
Insight into the mind and motivation of a wonderful artist.
How strange for most of us to see someone who MUST work.
I beg to differ.
The process of creation and destruction.
Of emergence and disappearing.
This is a romantic comedy with the emphasis on comedy for a change.
As a romantic counterpoint or foil to the leads are Robert Downey Jr.
But see this for Sally Field who is outstanding.
I can understand not wanting to hear him talk through the movie.
But The Shootings Did Leave And Effect.
The structure and execution of the film was fantastic.
Cal and Andre were phenomenal as the two disturbed classmates.
Very powerful and intense.
the end shooting sequence leaves you speechless because it is almost too realistic.
I really hope it gets the attention it deserves.
If you have got the chance you really should see it.
normal kids with normal families.
I was lucky enough to see Zero Day last night.
A very disturbing one at that.
Just your average kids.
They plan to shoot up there High School.
The movie is very chilling.
You really need to see it yourself.
This is the best movie I have come across in a long while.
He filmed it using teenage actors who were still attending high school.
It is almost artful.
and the tension in the final minutes of the movie is excruciating.
There is only one aspect of ZERO DAY that troubled me.
Yet these boys do not really seem angry.
They showed their life for about a year.
And THAT gives me the chills.
Of course I was.
I got to like them.
But I knew they were.
And that is why I can not go to sleep right now.
This movie is about a fictional soap opera.
It is very fast and funny.
To say anything else would ruin the movie.
There are several plots and sub plots in the movie.
They all gives over the top performances.
This movie is favorite of mine from the year 1991.
They showed their life for about a year.
And THAT gives me the chills.
Of course I was.
I got to like them.
But I knew they were.
And that is why I can not go to sleep right now.
I can honestly say it was very interesting indeed.
The problem is that little in terms of emotion is directly delivered.
The movie is amazing.
It feels like you are watching something that actually happened.
This movie is one for the ages.
Society left them behind and the consequences are horrifying and real.
Respect and love your fellow man.
It seems hard to really pinpoint.
They turn fantasy into tragedy.
Yet he is in his own way dominant.
Cal placates Andre and encourages him.
Whilst Cal has found someone offering him a way out.
The movie certainly picks up pace and improves as it nears its grim conclusion.
There is an excellent moment when Cal attends the high school prom.
We feel like shunning the masses as they have.
The penultimate scene is superb.
It is all too real and truly creates a sense of impending doom.
It is a character study well worth experiencing.
zero day is based of columbine high school massacre.
and its a video diary of two boys.
they is a lot to say about this movie.
the two boys act like they are in a weird cult.
they burn all there stuff.
so thats my review on zero day.
and lets just say the end shooting scene is messed up.
It really put things in perspective as I watched it.
This film would not have worked in any other format.
It also reminds us of the media storm that followed after.
This movie is a fictional version of our dreams coming true.
We get to see the kid behind the monster.
Misunderstood by some and picked on by others.
But together they stand and all will pay.
The first movie in years that left me absolutely staggered.
But then not all killers are raving lunatics foaming at the mouth.
They are just wired differently.
And that is perhaps the most chilling thought of all.
The characters are real human beings with logic and reasons behind their actions.
You get to understand them.
Overall though a really good movie on a very tough topic.
Their parents just think the guys are filming for a family home video.
I just came back from the Montreal premiere of Zero Day.
I understand how can young kids can be driven to do such horror.
High schools have became battle fields of conformity.
You need to fight your way into being like the others.
Cal expressed it well.
Drama is everywhere and it can take every shape.
and a scary one that might get to other kids.
Flawed but honest with a terrible honesty.
Especially the last scenes were almost painful to watch.
Hope it gets the distribution it deserves.
I rented Zero Day from the local video store last week.
I had never heard of the film and I had my reservations about it.
Zero Day is a phenomenal film.
It leaves you thinking about the lives involved.
And it leaves you perplexed how people get to this point.
The material in the film is disturbing.
This is not mainstream Hollywood and there is no happy ending.
this film is builds up solidly and it keeps you going.
The music is very different but very good.
Virginia begins to question just what is growing inside of her.
Brooke Adams stars as Virginia.
There they meet Dr.
It is fantastic on more levels than I can remember.
Love this film also.
It was really crowded and it was a very ambitious atmosphere to.
I can totally understand why nobody else ever tried to do something like this.
There already is something like this.
Detractors of this series tend to argue that it is formulaic and hopelessly dated.
and then kills it.
This is a classic that has somehow slipped through the cracks.
It fits the soap opera with it is flamboyant and melodramatic air.
D set coming out.
so many of them seem new all over again.
They just do not make stuff like this these days.
Great stories and a great cast and nothing else to weigh it down.
It works on both levels.
It truly gets better with age.
Never should have been on Fridays in the first place.
ABC had huge problems with Friday nights.
Watch it and weep.
10 out of 10.
You were scared for him and for the other characters too.
I could not even purchase the Jeff Rice novels.
Then something wonderful happened.
My twelve year old self would have adored it.
I am glad that the show was never revived though.
Without Oakland it would not have been the same.
I have the Rice books now and have read them several times.
What you do not see is sometimes more frightening than what you do.
you had to be there at the time but it was an interesting idea.
It is interesting and unusual to observe the diversity of opinion here.
This was made for them.
Perhaps some reviewers are taking it too seriously.
You can do a lot with a little cash.
Blair Witch proved that.
This film supports it.
It is no more than a sitcom in length and complexity.
I have recommended this film to all of my friends.
Sure wish he would make more films.
There also several visual gags that are quite ahead of their time.
The quintessential road movie.
The acting and direction were terrific.
In fact everything in the film seemed to flow except for the script.
This is one of the funniest movies I have seen.
This is a smaller film and I am willing to forgive minor things.
I enjoyed the acting of all of the major players.
This movie is awesome for three main reasons.
It is esthetically beautiful.
I absolutely loved that.
Sometimes they fall into clichés but this one does not.
There is a mix of humor and emotion throughout the film.
I like the end a lot.
And of course it is all about the Magician theme .
I rented this movie from blockbuster on a whim .
i guess i got lucky .
i laughed from beginning to end .
Miriam Hopkins and Claude Rains give wonderful performances.
Hopkins was a beautiful actress who really makes us feel for Mrs.
The driving force for Mrs.
The real merit of the picture is the cast.
Perhaps Lady with Red Hair contains his best work in films.
See it and enjoy him.
Still this slasher yarn offers plenty of nasty violence and gore.
Steers who plays the villain is fairly threatening.
The desert locations provide some atmosphere and the gore is rather strong.
8 out of 10.
I would give it 6.
5 out of 10.
A couple of the murders are indeed extremely macabre.
There are some surprisingly good performances on display from an extremely inexperienced cast.
The divine Jennifer McAllister does a superb job as the heroine and B.
Steers portrays off his rocker dementia with finesse.
But I do not know.
They are the underlying strength of the film.
You got things to say.
Told you 158 times I can not stand little notes on my pillow.
This movie is like strawberries dipped in chocolate.
A joy from start to finish.
Now THAT is only in the first few minutes.
This was the first time I would seen the always charming Teri Hatcher.
These men have great jobs though.
7 out of 10.
This film really works.
The supporting cast for this film is stellar as well.
It is about 2 men living together who are from opposite planets.
The script bristles with humor from this situation.
This had been done in some forms previously.
This is the one that brings it all together in a very good package.
It is hard to imagine Simon ever topping this.
He seems to have every health condition in the book.
Running throughout the movie are references to marriage.
Their friendship becomes an inadvertent hellish relationship.
The beginning 20 minutes are very boring.
The original film is still very good.
and laugh out loud funny in many scenes.
She calls Oscar and lets him know what happened.
After some side splitting hysterics it is agreed Felix will stay with Oscar.
I think that this is possibly the funniest movie I have ever seen.
easily surpassing the stage and screen versions of the tale.
The script is good.
And all in one scene.
What can I say.
this is a wonderful film that I can watch over and over.
It is definitely one of the top ten comedies made.
It is real to life situation done perfectly.
The joke is usually on themselves as oppose to passing the joke onto another.
Nicely photographed and directed.
The Odd Couple is a comic gem.
Thats when the fun begins.
It has a great cast who each give great performances.
Especially Sally Field and Kevin Kline.
No one delivers these lines better.
No one times them better.
Nobody does it better.
This cordial comedy confronts a few bizarre characters.
So he tries to kill himself but every attempt fails.
He offers his distressed friend Felix a new home in his apartment.
He cleans and cooks the whole time.
Filmed in a theatrical way and excellent acted.
He is the perfect clown.
The film is full of such amusing and at the same time touching scenes.
So there you have it.
Simply one of the best comedies and films ever.
It is I would venture one of the greatest comic films of all times.
The script is so sharp that you need to staunch the bleeding.
The story is well known and has already been described in other comments.
Ultimately it is not really possible to say anything else.
A FROLICS OF YOUTH Short Subject.
The abandoned spaniel he finds helps to change his mind.
As soon as he saw a dog in need he overcame his fear.
Years ago I did follow a soap on TV.
Many congrats to all who made it.
All is peaceful until a flea comes bouncing by.
The mutt is hilarious as he reacts to the flea.
The joke proved unintentionally prophetic.
Impressive during this course of history was what led to the struggle.
I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in World War II history.
and it is pretty interesting.
This is a good movie.
It tries to be the epic adventure of the century.
It more has the same feeling that a old Errol Flynn movie had.
You just can not hate it.
I think it is an okay adventure movie.
And I really love the soundtrack.
This was a really cool movie.
It reminds me of the story of Anne Frank.
She is cast very well as Hanna and immediately has our sympathy.
The second half of the film is the most interesting and tragic one.
The movie is filmed very good.
The music is good.
This is a very good and thrilling film.
Sadly a complete version of this may never get a decent release.
The English dubbing severely hurts the movie.
I do not understand.
Explain to me again how this is.
It is an incoherent mess.
It might have been a solo.
Rank amateur directing there.
But its a setup for a twisted scientific experiment to unleash his inner beast.
Post production was a nightmare.
Then its raining again.
And yet you do not look at it as a gaffe.
You can find it for free at Archive.
The world lost a great artist this month.
I absolutely LOVE this movie and would really like to have it someday.
His sister packs him some food and he goes.
This movie was great and I would like to buy it.
The boy goes with his grandfather to catch a young eagle.
the boy saves the eagle from being killed and runs away from the tribe.
Please if anyone knows where I can buy this movie let me know.
I still remember one of the opening lines.
He lived with his sister so and so in the village.
He gets to live the way he always wanted to.
He gets to soar the heavens.
There were some interesting films.
I was more of a movie goer then.
I have been searching for this film for years.
It was truly inspiring.
I too did not remember the Disney film.
I did not even remember that it was an opening film for Disney.
I truly wish they would show this on TV sometime.
And I was very impressed by it.
I remember that an Indian boy was friends with an eagle.
This impressed me very much.
As an eagle he was still wearing his turquoise necklace.
He has asked if it were possible for me to get this for him.
Since we have Indian blood he connects to this movie.
The story and images of this movie have been burned into my memory.
I loved it and want my kids to see it.
What a great story this really was.
I think it is only available on VHS.
What a wonderful era this was.
This is a good movie.
With pretty good performances.
If you like Falling down you are going to enjoy this one.
The story has been told before.
A deadly disease is spreading around.
He is indeed a desperate person just going home to see his child.
This person could be working next to you.
This is by far the most consistently hilarious comedy I have ever seen.
I can quote this movie for hours on end.
Piece of subtle art.
Doubtlessly a special story about the ambiguity of existence.
Images of Trial and same ambiguous woman.
Hypocrisy is a mask.
The acting by all of these actors is very good.
Hurt and Weller are really excellent in this film.
I thought that they performed good.
The thrills is really good and some of it is surprising.
The movie is filmed very good.
The music is good.
This is a very good and thrilling film.
Now some years later he is now in Russia or someplace.
Now as I said before this film is a lot like Falling Down.
SHE is famous for cursing a priest which came true.
which does happen at the end of the movie.
cable network while I was flipping channels.
The premise is reasonably simple.
Just that is more of snail mail.
Very slow snail mail.
This is a great film.
The cinematography is gorgeous and there are a number of big name actors.
This movie helps to image those kinds of stories and memories.
Some people just do not get it.
Kline and Fields are great.
Just a lot of fun.
Very good acting and script.
Very touching as well for the spiritually mature.
Not for people who do not like to think.
She soon discovers that she has nowhere to go.
This not very well known picture is well written and acted.
The location is breathtaking.
This film gives some insight of Japanese culture here and across the ocean.
Distortion is a movie that sort of caught me by surprise.
His wife has no idea that this is happening.
The detective hired by the playwright becomes a character in the play.
The premise is simple.
This is one of the best thrillers of 2005.
A great eye candy.
This could be the best.
They have a couple of drinks and end up sitting together on the plane.
And what does this have to with Lisa.
Definitely worth the see.
The emotions was in right choose.
Idea and script of this movie is great too.
The doctor ends up renting her a house and buying her a car.
o such foolishness here.
Yes you see a few characters but they really only interact with the principals.
Such as the husband wife at the motel whose room was canceled.
The bad guy in particular needs her in the beginning of the flight.
The rude guy in the airport was important to the movie too.
She thinks what she can do to stall time.
Any other movie the smart executive women would be acting like idiots.
But not this one.
Was Craven should do more of these types of movies.
Also one last comment.
He is completely unrecognizable.
I was bored one night and Red Eye was on and thought why not.
Red Eye is one of the best movies in a long time.
I mean I just got into the movie cause it was just so brilliant.
The story is new and different.
Red Eye is just phenomenal.
Nothing more and nothing less.
I give Red Eye 9 out of 10.
I will not give anything away.
Then we move on to where Jack is chasing Lisa in the airport.
There is nearly twelve minutes of violence and strong intensity throughout that entire scene.
Not only was the movie intense but it had a great plot to it.
Red Eye I have to say is better than 10 out of 10 stars.
thrilling as I found it.
I rather tended to forget I was watching a movie.
That says a lot.
The death of her grandmother sends her on a flight which delayed several times.
a flight where she meets Jack.
She succeeds in saving them.
A great thrill ride all the way through.
Wes Craven depicts the story of a regular hotel worker Lisa.
Then this is when the horror starts.
This is an excellent example of a bone shaking production.
Wes Craven did well with this film.
that will stay with you for weeks.
I will leave it at that.
Red Eye is a good little thriller to watch on a Saturday night.
This movies strongest point is its cast.
This film needed good actors to deliver the dialog and thrills.
We had Rachel McAdams from Mean Girls and Wedding Crashers.
The pacing in this film was great.
Much better then the other flight movie Flight Plan.
Not too long and not too shabby.
Greetings again from the darkness.
Craven even has a cameo as one of the passengers on the plane.
She is a natural.
WES CRAVEN is at his best ever.
He brings us an amazing end of summer thriller I was so desperately craving.
This is THE thriller of the year.
All the actors are amazing and the action is realistic and fun.
It steadily built suspense.
I was on the edge of my seat most of the movie.
The film is very fast pace and exciting with no slow or boring spots.
Wes Craven does a really good job behind the camera.
Red Eye really shows his skills at storytelling.
Red Eye also works well because of its young and talented cast.
Rachel McAdams gives a very engaging performance and her character is hard to hate.
You may even end up cheering for her out loud.
The way he acts charming at first but then turns psycho is especially impressive.
There are a few unrealistic moments that may distract the viewer.
If you expect a horror movie then you will end up disappointed.
Had me on the edge of my seat.
But these folks were probably right to keep the movie so tightly focused.
as I'm not sure it makes a great deal of sense.
Just sit back and enjoy.
No cheap make up.
As always she delivers an entertaining and convincing performance.
Wes finally gets it right.
I had fun watching Red Eye.
At least not another Scream with the usual college killer.
I saw an advanced screening for this movie tonight.
I absolutely loved it.
The movie kept me on the edge of my seat all night.
He played his character very well.
Rachel McAdams was great.
The suspense is held through out the movie.
I was not disappointed in the end.
The trailer does not do the movie justice.
The movie is much better than the trailer indicated.
Do not wait for this movie to come out on video.
75 to see it.
Hitchcock understood that people go the the movies to have a good time.
Something that Hollywood seems to have forgotten in recent years.
Rachel McAdams is wonderful as always.
The directing is surprising stylish.
The story is good but the dialog could have used some sprucing up.
I'm quite functional in my personal and professional life.
Many addicts have suffered miserable abuse.
Some kids simply respond badly to divorce.
Often it is those of us with smaller issues who suffer the longest.
This is followed by an intervention which is then followed by an outcome.
This makes the positive outcomes all the better.
Another thing I like about the show is the quality of the camera work.
Now for the bad.
The film is stunning.
It is a crude portrait of the city.
Or it is like The Brave One.
A film that shocks and hits you in the guts very hard.
Leaves you shaking and stunned.
Four of the best filmmakers in the contemporary Mexican cinema.
A surprisingly good cast.
If you had an assault without a scratch then you are lucky.
And it is a beautiful life in Mexico.
I nearly puked when I saw some of the images.
The recreation of a similar situation in this film shocked me deeply.
Those are meaningless compared with the actions of the people.
With a few exceptions they are all perfect examples of human rubbish.
The music by A.
I saw this movie when it first came out.
This is not your ordinary psycho movie.
Lots of interesting and original slants on the genre.
A most awaited film of the year 2002.
Its a good entertaining movie and gives good messages also.
I will rate this movie as Good instead of Excellent because of the screenplay.
Its a must watch movie.
Lexi is admitted to hospital.
This film shows it as it is.
She gets better and then has a drawback.
I think this movie shows all of that very well.
There should be more movies like this.
The product is one of the most beautiful and unique films in recent memory.
This film is not in black and white.
But lurking in the distance are the vikings.
Forget what you think you know about this film you are wrong.
Its a simple story with so much more going on.
There is death and destruction and joy and happiness.
Its not sugar coated.
Its a film that looks unlike any other.
the Images are designed to fill the available space as much as possible.
Its stunningly beautiful and best described as art come to life.
I can not say more than that.
Its one of the best animated films I have ever run across.
And the comic relief is sometimes a bit too broad.
But these are minor problems with an otherwise delightful and superbly imaginative film.
The cast is excellent I think.
It felt like a slight acid trip.
I figured I was just missing a piece of Irish history.
I originally thought the animation was flat and boring.
The edges of the screen become framed in decorated moving triangles or circles.
This is one of them.
Brendan is not fond of the wall and neither are the other monks.
One day a traveler comes from the island of Iona near Scotland.
Aidan has special plans for Brendan.
There are things worse than Vikings out there.
The animation here contains a lot of similar designs and patterns.
It enhances the film.
We are reminded of it is importance but never fully understand.
That was really the only lacking portion of the film.
Otherwise I thought the story was interesting though completely outdone by the animation.
I guess that is okay to a certain degree.
The animation can carry a film so far before it falls short.
I think it will help your viewing experience a lot more.
This a very impressive and beautifully illustrated film that should definitely not be missed.
The reds used in the Viking invasion sequence is unforgettably haunting.
Try to catch this quiet gem of a film.
You fall in love with the characters from the moment you meet them.
The groundswell of support amongst our animation community is phenomenal.
I'm here to tell you now it is been worth the wait.
May there be many more.
The startling conclusion packs a mean and lingering wallop right to the gut.
A solid and satisfying winner.
I love the pace of the show and the fast upbeat music.
just incredible considering what an monumentally difficult race it is.
You are all wonderful.
If you loved Long Way Round you will enjoy this nearly as much.
Ewan makes a few appearances but Charley really pulls it off alone.
It is a motorcycle movie though and anyone on two wheels will love this.
The series features stunning photography as well as a few interviews of peoples mouths.
Great to see him with Ewan again.
As for their being no mention of it on the package.
They should have given it a 15 just for the language alone.
Wonderful location shooting in Hawaii.
The photography and the compositions are excellent.
Bow settles her hash fast.
Popping in a CD has it is advantages.
Except in the Twilight Zone.
It has a good plot and it is unique.
This movie also has a very good ending.
the list goes on.
There was one slight disappointment for me however.
you get the picture.
Well to the actual plot of the film.
This movie i have been dying to see.
Well it took till now to decide to actually rent it.
It was completely worth it.
This movie made me laugh from the beginning to the end.
Chris Rock is funny no matter which movie he is in.
Great movie when I saw it.
Have to say one of my favorite movies of all time.
Also the thought of how the movie goes is a nice way of thinking.
I like the movie overall so i give it a.
but I saw past that flaw and saw a solid comedy.
This movie is a remake of two movies that were a lot better.
This one is not so great.
It all seems real fake and the editing is just bad.
I do not know how they could release this movie like that.
Because I absolutely loved it and found it to be a little hidden treasure.
I really can not think of anything bad to say about it.
But I found all the characters very intriguing and sympathetic.
But I guess the title already kind of gives that away.
I have seen this film several times.
they run a close comparison and definitely are more modern to reach people.
I have seen this movie a whole dozen times and it is awesome.
I think that it would be interesting to do a remake of it.
Hard for any girl to look good with him.
Europa is probably the differential for its greatness in visual terms.
This is what he offers to us constantly through his work over and over.
I have read most of the comments on this movie.
No one got scared or traumatized like I have read on some posts.
The movie is just based on biblical facts.
back then there were only 4 or 5 TV stations to choose from.
The Vietnam war was just over.
There will still be 7 years before Star Wars comes out.
They just needed to find an excuse and blamed A Thief In The Night.
No one can ever blame themselves because they are always right.
Just like these whiners who complain about the movie.
These people must be full grown adults.
Something new is always good.
Trust your own instincts.
This is a great movie.
If you can see this movie.
I think the U.
will play a major role in the world government to come.
The last days are lining up with the Bible.
The viewer is able to watch the show without being distracted by sloppy craftsmanship.
The message of the movie is superb.
I plan on showing it to my teen group at church.
The fashion in the movie was exactly the same fashion of its time.
Overall a good episode.
What used to terrify me in junior high now makes me laugh.
It even has the SAME EXACT score of Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
I think I'm the only person in history to make that observation.
I saw myself acting out just like her.
Anyone who has struggled with manic depression could get so much from this movie.
Never mind about if it showed her awards or what they were for.
That is not the issue here.
It was so real.
It was like watching myself up there on screen.
I wish I could thank Ms.
I have a lot of respect for her as a person.
It is unfortunate that when a celebrity suffers that is what helps people most.
I always thought she was great and always will.
I am glad that she wrote this book and that the movie was made.
She is a remarkable lady and I hope she continues to act.
She has been through a lot and has faced it.
The movie was so moving to me that I was very touched.
She was a household name in America by age 15.
The plot is flyweight.
Television horror film hostess Elvira dreams of success in Las Vegas.
Actress Cassandra Peterson has to this date ridden on that success.
Her agent Manny proves a disappointment.
Her voluptuous figure and winning personality soon draws the youth of the town.
And the breasts of Cassandra Peterson become a character of their own.
Someone posted that it could be better written and it could be.
But with a horror host instead of a lawyer.
Sadly it is a wasted opportunity.
With just a bit more writing it could be a classic.
Apart from the obvious reasons.
It would have been great to see their relationship flourish.
Elvira herself is always fun and engaging.
Every time she smiles you will too.
The sort of person you would let look after your kids.
I would recommend giving it a go.
Just do not expect too much.
The other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons.
They just do not make movies like this anymore.
But the uptight townspeople of Falwell are in for a treat.
How can one not forget Daniel Greene once you have seen.
Even Robert Rodriguez could not have made that shot look any better.
but its not all that easy.
hope you like it in total i will have to give it a 0.
com if you wanna.
And yet another run of South Park comes to an end.
Another inspired South Park moment.
Now we must wait until October for the next batch of episodes.
I think that this movie is very fun and horror.
I love Elvira and I like this movie.
I think that she is amazing actress with big.
Cassandra Peterson is one of my favorite comedy actresses.
You can rely on me.
But the fact that I remember it speaks volumes.
One more rewrite for the ending was needed.
um past revealing her enormous.
There are many references made to the wizard of oz throughout the movie.
she and her uncle both quote lines relevant to their parallel characters.
This film is pure Elvira and shows her at her breast.
I mean that in a good way though.
The supporting characters were pretty shallow and mediocre.
She is lovable and adorable.
Cassandra Petersen has a world of acting talent that just glows in this movie.
Few men could disagree with that.
I had a smile ear to ear from the first scene to the last.
I wish they had made a dozen more Elvia movies.
Also check out ELVIRA'S HAUNTED HILLS.
It will not shake the world or change movies forever.
What it will do is entertain.
There are never enough.
He exudes a wonderful refined malice.
I could find no technical faults.
The execution is as close to flawless as the art form gets.
This tender beautifully crafted production delved deep down bitter sweet into my being.
Mr Harvey is experiencing much pain throughout .
Harvey during a school field trip to Salisbury Cathedral.
The cathedral accomplishes its goal.
This is a very powerful and very inspiring movie.
The resolution between the graffiti boy and the Muslim was gratifying but less believable.
if you have a chance of seeing this film do see it.
in my opinion it is a piece of art.
I do not know why it was so fantastic but it simply was.
So many of the characters were so real.
A fine effort for an Australian show.
but it is reminiscent of early secret life of us.
lets hope the show keeps improving with each episode.
I can safely say I'm now glad that I did.
It is a satire of how people treat the homeless.
He dropped the Big Pass in more ways than one.
this film explores that and more.
Succeeds on Many Levels.
The fateful game took place in 1972.
That means that the protagonists graduated in 1972.
But almost all of the music played at the dances etc.
The film did not do well at the box office.
I saw it in a sneak preview.
I have always enjoyed the film.
Robin did well with his role.
I am not a football fan or a real sports fan.
Spoiler This movie is about such a concept.
Russel plays the ex jock who peaked in high school.
A great reverse tragedy.
The Best of Times is one of the great sleepers of all time.
There is lots of sentimentality.
The cast also includes many great supporters.
The fight spread outside the ring and Noble threw his girlfriend into the challenger.
Brock pulled himself together and began to take charge.
Stephanie McMahon stepped out to issue her own pitch.
She said the two of them were once unstoppable and they can be again.
Triple H said that was a tempting offer.
The Canadians took over from there.
Edge tagged in soon after and dropped both opponents.
Test raced down and took down Hogan then leveled Edge with a boot.
The Rock retaliated by latching on the ankle lock to Kurt Angle.
Taker picked Rock up and crashed him with the Last Ride.
He dropped the Big Pass in more ways than one.
Great fun for anyone wishing to enjoy their youth again.
I guess that everyone has to make a comeback at some point.
But Williams and Russell are actually a pretty good comedy team.
This movie surprisingly had a lot of good twists and turns.
This movie has everything you want from an action movie.
Does this sounds cheesy.
Of course it is.
You could argue about the twists being predictable.
But more about the journey to that moment.
8 out of 10.
This movie surprised me in a good way.
Things get more complicated as nobody seldom tells the truth about things.
Made men is well worth checking out.
But especially Timothy Dalton plays a very good roll as the Sheriff.
Great entertainment from start to the end.
Some twists and many action scenes.
and that taxidermy has to do with stuffing animals.
Please do not ruin this great piece by your simple mindedness.
The reasons are far more complex than the single thing you mentioned.
Please read the book as is it a great source of information.
I enjoyed it a lot.
This book is even a taught as a text book at some universities.
Not to my ear.
Additionally there is a good music video.
The ending was quick though.
It ended off quickly which was perfect for this match.
Easily the match of the year.
This is by far the best triple threat match i have ever seen.
No one could predict who would come out of this one.
They say documentary presents information which is taught in middle school.
Neither did I see native peoples portrayed as poor little innocent things.
The common denominator here is the awesome House Band.
Get those boys a good lead singer and they are going places.
This is almost typical Lynch.
The performances are great and the short is thought provoking.
Many questions are left unanswered and this ignites the imagination.
Another brilliant effort from Lynch.
I really think that people are taking the wrong approach at this one.
I just take it for what it is.
I think the suspense and mystery are ingenious in their insinuation upon the watcher.
And in good right.
Lynch is not about that.
At least this side of Lynch is not.
There is diagonal pan.
Zooms also go back and forth sometimes.
This can be felt even in this crappy room.
This is your typical Lynch short.
I am watching the series back to back as fast as possible.
I am attempting to watch all things Star Trek.
Star Trek is the greatest television phenomenon ever achieved.
This portion of the film is almost spot on in that regard.
It just seems so tragic but needs to be told.
Powers Boothe give a commanding performance as the leader Rev.
Jim Jones from obscurity until total madness.
I have seen this film literally over 100 times.
These should be evident to most independent observers.
Many people know how it feels when a loved one is lost.
She wears a flowered dress and apron with a sun hat on her head.
The tragic passing of Ruth affects Will deeply.
They also add a subtle humor to the bittersweet story.
The film is endlessly unpredictable.
Its shot in black and white with shots of color randomly appearing throughout.
This is now a personal favorite film of mine.
Jones physical likeness to Jones is uncanny and the story is acted out chillingly.
The movie keeps you riveted and is a must see for anyone.
A disturbing reflection on human nature and its weaknesses.
Not to let it be repeated again.
Rented the movie as a joke.
I loved the credit at the end of the movie as well.
In short a great movie if you are looking for something to laugh at.
A Great watch for children and adults of all genders.
Puff N Stuff had hinted towards marijuana smoking.
Your kids will love this movie.
I enjoyed it very much as a child.
My father showed me this movie as a child.
Although at the time I had no clue about what those were.
The movie is comedy and adventure.
The storyline is wacky and cheerful.
I and you shall enjoy this together.
Everything was better in past days.
But they are not the only creatures.
After seeing Dick Tracy in the 6.
I do not think you will be disappointed.
This is the perfect film for anybody to watch with their children.
I still liked it though.
She did not belong in this movie and her acting job was pretty bad.
The movie at some points just stood still.
You expected something more and you got nothing.
I did not see Ishtar but I heard bad things.
The reason to watch this movie is the atmosphere.
The costumes and makeup were flawless as well.
The facial makeup for the villains was great.
Of course that movie was much bigger in terms of gross.
Dick Tracy was originally a comic book created in 1931 by Chester Gould.
Go buy it today.
You will not be sorry.
This movies is the best movie to watch for comic book feel.
This is truly one entertaining movie.
Something is wrong with that picture.
Personally I give it a 10.
It is a movie based on a comic book hero.
This movie won more than it is share of awards.
right there tells me it is better than a 5.
If you are looking for pure entertainment be sure to check out Dick Tracy.
Definitely a movie you can watch more than a few times.
I saw Dick Tracy when I was very young.
I sure loved it though.
He or she is very unknown.
I thought that this movie was very colorful and creative.
It was entertaining and fun to watch especially as a child.
Take my word for it.
The film is a continuation of sight gags that are perfectly taken seriously.
I love the bright colors vs.
Beautiful scenery and mood transport you directly into a comic strip environment.
To me it is not bad at all.
The surreal feeling really got me.
Almost all the suits are elaborate in blues and greens and yellows and reds.
The humor is plentiful.
Dick Tracy is one of my all time favorite films.
You will either really love it or really hate it.
It came out a year after the success of Batman.
But its based on a comic strip.
This is one of the best characters Madonna has ever played.
I thoroughly enjoyed this true to form take on the Dick Tracy persona.
Dick Tracy is easily the best comic book based movie made to date.
just sit back with some popcorn and enjoy this one.
Great fun for kids and adults alike.
7 out of 10.
The list is far too long.
Just taking a look at one scene from the film is breathtaking.
I hope she can keep acting and directing.
Check the full credits on the main page and you will amazed.
like nothing you have ever seen.
The whole score was terrible.
I thought I was back in junior high school.
But there were also times when the emotion ran thick.
Nice try on an epic film.
it turned out mediocre though.
I guess you could say I was a little bit disappointed.
You have wonderful animation and at first what seems like a perfect story.
A story about absolutely nothing but a horse in nature.
Very pretty visuals though.
This is a wonderful movie in a lot of ways.
Everyone in my family enjoyed it.
But it is done tastefully and is not offensive at all.
I have loved Disney for years and will continue to do so.
I had the same feeling.
I thoroughly recommend it.
This movie was highly entertaining.
Even more impressive is Brian Adams doing all the songs in French as well.
The score is also uplifting and dramatic.
The result is truly stunning.
The story is compelling and well narrated.
I do not understand anyone who would rank this movie less than a 7.
A man readjusts to life alone after 45 years of marriage.
This was a great movie with a good story.
The music was also fantastic.
This movie really gives you a sense of family and home and friends.
Your kids will love it.
I think you will too.
People I know hate it because Spirit was the only horse that talked.
The drawn animation is a special thing about many animations.
This is what makes the movie so goo.
I liked this movie a lot.
The animation was well done and the romance was cute.
The opening scenery and music were very stirring.
The film is a lament to an America that was once beautiful.
The horse is indeed a fine animal.
The animation is simply stupendous.
Soundtrack too is very impressive.
The wonderful instrumental music lures you to appreciate the movie.
It is one of the best animation flicks i have watched.
Would be a very fine choice on a lonely night.
If only ALL animation was this great.
The characters in this film are beautifully personified.
Charlie is clearly the most interesting figure.
Not one to be missed.
Still the movie has its moments and is quite watchable.
There is at least one funny moment.
Something of a surprise.
The film starts out very well.
The opening commercial is a very nice touch.
I also can not see why anybody would not love Scarface.
this movie is just great.
Montana was all for doing what you wanted to do with your life.
This falls under my top 10 favorite movies.
Definitely a movie you must see.
However the real hero in the story are the bison and the northwest.
This movie has it all.
Great movie and you will probably really enjoy it.
This is still a superb film.
He is the dominant star of this film.
The chainsaw incident is downright brutal and their is blood everywhere.
Of course this is more than just a film about excess.
This is a film about the darker side of the American dream.
In many ways it puts it on a thematic par with The Godfather films.
This IS THE BEST FILM EVER MADE.
I disagree but this movie is very very good.
The psychological effects of what they are doing are well depicted.
This is one of my favorite films of all time.
Murray Abraham and Angel Salazar.
He manages to bring reality to his character that leaves a strong impression.
The supporting cast served its job very well.
Robert Loggia I have always enjoyed watching in just seeing him yell.
Everybody just seemed to fit their roles by being there.
They did not fit in perfectly but were convincing enough.
The writing was great it was just pure Oliver Stone.
That is a testament to him though.
Nobody knows how to write a surreal reality for a movie than Oliver Stone.
The music was good but not that great.
He is not inspiring in anyway.
In a freaky twisted way he is a necessity of our society.
This in no way excuses people like him.
And he will also know whether or not it was worth it.
Tony is upset and nothing can stop him now.
the film has a great supporting cast among them is F.
The movie has a magnificent look to it.
For the rest of you it is highly recommended.
Tony Montana would and did ANYTHING to achieve it.
Tony was living high off the hog.
but it drives the point disturbingly home.
Give me a break.
This movie is entertaining and you will never get bored.
This is a masterpiece and i recommend that you see this.
You will not be disappointed.
A classic is also something that everyone praises but no one has read.
It is praised for all the wrong reasons.
And that is why the film works so well.
Not a promotion of it.
It has great cinematography that pulls you into the story.
The acting is terrific.
These three dig the film as deep as it can go.
Always go into a film unsuspecting.
This is one of my all time favorites.
The Last Hunt is the forgotten Hollywood classic western.
The laugh here is that Bronson used to play Indians.
Today a large remnant bison herd resides in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming.
She looks beautiful and is adequate in her role.
The director does go a bit overboard during a particular part in the climax.
I saw this movie about a week ago and still keep thinking about it.
I was very moved by this movie.
I found the characters very believable and likable almost to a fault.
I found this film to be a fascinating study of a family in crisis.
The film is a character study on how this family deals with its subject.
I loved this movie.
It had great production values.
Beyond the grim statistics are personal stories that we rarely hear about.
Leo tells him that he is ill and Marcel is sad but accepting.
I am still haunted by the final scene.
This is quite a dull movie.
I assume he loves her.
I know the answers do not add up but please take a stand.
It leaves you with a very fine aftertaste.
Its setting is serious.
Its elegant styling never and nowhere puts any weight on your mind.
The casting is impressive.
The latter seasons disastrous reshuffle contributed to its three season short life span.
Plus a comedy about a paparazzi reporter was original to boot.
A lot of things do not make sense to me.
She wants her freedom but it comes at a cost.
Her boss is played by the wonderful and divine Holland Taylor.
if the opportunity arises.
The film really moves along and there is excellent direction and good camera work.
But I have a few complaints.
There are only two false steps in this 1993 film.
He kills both buffalo and Indians for pure pleasure.
The most entrancing points in the movie are the entirely cinematographic ones.
An underwater shot of proliferating blood.
An uncommonly expressive sequence on what it must be like to drown.
Both visually and musically stunning.
A treat for both the eye and the ear.
The dancing of many of the lead artistes is breathtakingly good.
This movies chronicles the life and times of William Castle.
A must see for Castle fans and horror movie fans.
That aside this is just great.
So I hope this documentary acknowledged that.
I look forward to seeing it.
Trevor Howard decides their best course of action is to run for it.
They should have stayed put.
This film plays really well with an audience.
Especially once the chase begins.
The chase that ensues helps bring out the truth.
This is an entertaining film.
Seek it out if you can find it.
The Clouded Yellow is a compact psychological thriller with interesting characterizations.
She is raised by a tribe in Africa.
The point is that A.
it is hilarious until Danny Glover adopts it and it is friend.
Because later he got a job as a writer for numerous prank shows.
But how can you stand to mange a baseball team that can not win.
P hide in a tree to watch the angels play baseball.
This movie was about a couple of orphaned children who wanted a family.
This movie is perfect for families to watch together.
It is a great film and it deserves more credit.
The special effects are stunning and spectacular.
Everyone who has children should share this with theirs.
great for the entire family to watch.
I happened to catch this movie on cable one afternoon.
What I found more interesting was the depiction of the foster family system.
Sidekick Milton Davis Jr.
But that is just nitpicking.
I might as well have the money as well.
This film was pretty good.
are brought in with a variety of talented actors and understanding of the sport.
William Dear and the guys put together a great movie.
I thought that this was reasonably well done.
This movie can also be the interest of avid baseball fans.
I think this is a lovely family movie.
The actors are great and the effects well executed throughout.
All ages will love this movie.
Christopher Lloyd is hilarious and is perfect for the part.
I really enjoyed this movie as a young kid.
That was definitely the case with Angels in the Outfield.
It is also hilarious.
Its an energetic movie.
Therein lies my gripe.
To top it off the setting is beautiful and the cinematography excellent.
find something to believe in.
But this supernatural comedy is still a hilarious and worthwhile entertainment.
My vote is eight.
She adds appropriate body language for comic effect.
In fact it stinks of Curse of the Jade Scorpion.
Being entirely innocent has nothing to do with it nor does unequivocal guilt.
Though the plot seemed old Woody still has a knack for one liners.
I did find his allusions to his last film interesting.
If not watch something else.
The river Styx was pure genius.
This was much better than the newspaper critics made it sound out to be.
Directed by Woody Allen.
He plays the perfect bumbling magician.
There have been a few reviews maligning this movie.
She starts to romance him but quickly falls in love.
It was shorter and moved much more quickly.
I give it an 8.
The two would be P.
s conjure an invitation to a club where Peter Lyman goes to swim.
Allen has taken himself from the romantic lead pawing his gorgeous leading lady.
Both are excellent in their banter throughout the film.
He makes a good appearance in the movie as the man pursuing Ms.
I say give it a chance because you just might like it.
It seems that as directors reach a certain age they really get things right.
The second he walked on screen audience lit up.
Scoop is classic Woody Allen.
I would even say some shades of Hitchcock.
The plot turns are nice and tight.
Less stylized than Mighty Aphrodite.
Less forced than Small Time Crooks or Hollywood Ending.
Woody has finally found a comic voice that works in the 21st century.
Greetings again from the darkness.
What is most striking to us 40 plus year fans is that Mr.
This attraction motivated him to write his best comedy in years.
She is unafraid to look and act like a real person.
especially the banter between Allen and Scarlett.
especially the Strauss composition.
I saw this film about twenty years ago on the late show.
He did not get enough roles like this during his long career.
This is his best performance.
He is totally believable in a truly villainous role.
He basically would just do what MGM gave him.
This film proves that he could have handled more diverse and difficult roles.
This film is definitely worth a look.
Sondra and Sid immediately become a pair of amateur sleuths.
His parents were English.
On a hot day you do not want a heavy meal.
And his body moves pretty fast too.
They were the exception though because everyone else including myself really enjoyed themselves.
If you are a Woody Allen fan you will probably enjoy yourself.
The classical music score is an excellent compliment to the action on screen.
Scarlett Johanson looks gorgeous in that bathing suit.
The last shot of the film alone is worth the admission price.
I went to the movie theater this afternoon expecting to be underwhelmed by Scoop.
Even the fluffy stuff.
This is a excellent series.
One thing they all share is they miss their mom.
And I love Michelle.
This show can relate to children and teens and.
I love the episode when I think her name is DD.
That was a great episode.
I recommend this show for everyone.
Full House is a great show.
I am still today growing up on it.
she is my favorite.
she had such a sense of humor.
it really is a good show.
i really think that this show should go down to many generations in families.
and it is great too because it is an appropriate show for all ages.
i give it 5 out of 5 stars.
It will make you feel a lot better.
you really should watch it and you will get hooked on it.
well i need must go to have some lunch.
I do not know what I would have done without Full House on television.
Both kids and adults will love this show.
The location was Sylvan Lake in the Black Hills.
So this Dakota youth looked forward to seeing the movie and was not disappointed.
The local buffalo herd was being culled so the shooting scenes were for real.
Full House came to me when I was about 9.
I think the comments regarding the show being cheesy are a bit too exaggerated.
It makes you laugh and it is not just humor.
I grew up watching Full House as a child.
Now my kids watch the show and they love to watch it as well.
It has good teachings your kids can learn from.
It talks about real life problems and family matters.
There is always a lesson you can learn from the show.
I vote the show a 10.
There is never a dull moment in Full House.
when i started high school back in 2000.
a few days after i graduated high school in 2004.
and the characters are so awesome.
Danny Tanner reminds me of my mother and grandmother.
Joey is good natured and is always in a good mood.
somehow you can actually tell that DJ is a California girl.
and Stephanie is so cool.
also i have a hard time telling the Olsen twins apart.
i want my kids to watch it one day.
i just wished they could have made a 9th season.
but season 5 and 6 i think are the best.
Full House is a great family show.
Probably the best season is the first.
Once they live there together they find they can not live without each other.
This show is about three little girls.
So the whole show is about living life.
The whole show is basically about to go with the flow.
You do not have to hold grudges you just have to let it go.
I think this show is really good and fun to watch.
I grew up watching this show and still watch it today.
I am glad they still air this show on television.
I watch it almost every day.
Who brought the cheese.
During it is run it became a phenomenon.
The Anorexic Twins became popular.
This is when life was good and simple.
This is one of the great American classics.
It was humorous and always brought home a good lesson.
This is why I dare say.
It could have gone much later than it did.
But i need those real ones to come up with another new episode.
The Show is about Danny Tanner who is guy who does news for sports.
They all live under one roof with no one to help them out.
What a little gem.
The understated cinematography is superb and terribly realistic.
Probably because those in the movie were real killing fields.
Full House was and still is a great show.
I would love to see the cast interviewed now.
This is how I feel about the show.
I started watching the show in reruns in 2001.
I enjoy the show but it had too many faults.
Actors playing different roles in different episodes.
Danny all of a sudden playing the guitar.
Only in a TV show.
I did like the D.
I have never seen a show as good as Full House.
It is a great show for anyone of any age.
The plot of the show is very believable.
Jesse is a rock star waiting to get his big break.
He looses his wife in car accident involving a drunk driver.
Playing the character of Joey was perfect for him.
She is one of the best actresses I have ever seen.
Her acting ability in Full House was very believable.
It was supposed to be where she was going to get her big break.
She showed great enthusiasm.
Most young kids can not do this.
Full House is where they got their start.
There are many more cast members that should be recognized.
I think it was to focused on her towards the end.
Especially when I think Jodie and Candice were much better at acting.
Full House is a great show for everyone.
It can teach you a lot.
Full House continues to attract new fans.
Full House has made me laugh and cry.
I have heard people say Full House is cheesy and unbelievable.
The sisters fight and get their feelings hurt.
The three men who live with the girls can get into bickers at times.
They are great actresses and seem to be very nice people.
Buster in his blissful innocence botches every act.
I used to watch this show when I was a little girl.
Two things I remember vaguely are the opening sequence and theme song.
I hope some network brings it back so I can see every episode.
This show has improved very much over the years.
Then later on though it was good but not great.
My favorite has got to be Wildcat.
Jim Cummings did a perfect job of impersonating the original voice.
And the villains were very original.
These are only a few of my favorite episodes.
When the camera moves on and away from Mr.
And director BROOKS is really a superb storyteller.
The stories are engaging and very plausible.
I can laugh myself to tears in a few choice ones.
The next day he leaves for the air circus.
The Characters have a lot of depth to them.
She can be a real hellion sometimes.
I can not get enough of this show.
One of the silliest subtitles I have seen.
This movie was beautiful.
She is not listed in the credits.
This is the most compelling and excellent performance that Robert Taylor ever gave.
Acting was very good.
Story had a unique and interesting arrangement.
The absence of violence and porno sex was refreshing.
Characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings.
I think the film is educational.
Big opportunity was missed to tell the world what they actually believe.
We may have a Mormon president some day.
I think it is definitely worth watching.
The background scenery is beautiful.
I would definitely recommend watching this movie.
We already know Joseph Smith was human.
but it takes a lot to move me to tears.
This film is a true and historical film.
It is an excellent film and I recommend it.
But most importantly it reveals the restoration of the church.
This movie was the best movie I have ever seen.
I highly recommend this movie for everyone.
This is one of the most spiritual movies I have ever seen.
I headed up with about 150 people to St.
George and we saw this movie in the visiting center of the St.
Not one person had dry eyes in the audience.
This is a movie about Joseph Smith and a great one at that.
This was a really great show.
The actors gave wonderful portrayals of the characters in the movie.
The story was accurately portrayed.
He thinks she is ridiculous for making the trip and is discouraging.
This is where the story of the Prophet Joseph Smith begins.
The way in which the story was presented was touching.
If nothing else but to gain some understanding of his life.
It will increase your testimony of this most incredible man.
This is a must see.
This is a very entertaining film and the acting was outstanding.
Good western filmed in the rocky Arizona wilds.
One really dumb scene shows Heston emptying .
Most of them seem to be inspired by Sam Peckinpah.
IMO the beginning is very good.
Maybe both had troubles with the director or were unhappy with their roles.
He is portraying the bad guy between maniac hate and cleverness.
His role and his acting is the best of the movie.
Landscapes and Shootouts are terrific.
The shootings scenes are bloody and the violence looks realistic.
Zach Provo and his gang had some gory and violent scenes.
What I miss is the typical western action in the middle of the movie.
I would have appreciated a bank robbery or something similar.
Overall it is an entertaining western flick.
I have seen this film on Sky Cinema not too long ago.
Most of the actors played it out really well.
But that how it was.
Very good to watch.
Great score from the late Jerry Goldsmith.
Wonderful piece of Western persona.
There were even buffalo killing contests.
government officers even promoted the destruction of the bison herds.
The buffalo nation was destroyed by greed and uncontrolled hunting.
He also enjoy killing Indians who steal his horses.
But Taylor steals the show.
Do he and his friends head for the Mexican border from jail and safety.
His Indian woman was killed in the hail of bullets fired.
He knows that Heston has to make it personal then.
The Last Hard Men is one nasty and brutal western.
Of which there is a lot.
It is a western that deserves nothing less.
He teaches at his school railing against human rights abuses.
Unfortunately this is also it is biggest drawback.
C efforts which forces the company to find a new identity.
It was actually believable.
I like the movie.
Melissa Joan Hart is a good actress.
Twisted Desire is my second favorite movie.
But i still love Jeremy Jordan.
Certainly worth a watch.
My only complaint is that their appeared to be no closure.
Perhaps that is part of the point.
You can see a bit of what is yet to come.
I look forward to a chance to see The Papal Chase.
v as i think she is fine.
It made me think.
Now I'm interested to find out the facts of the real case.
Little did I know.
You just do not expect this sort of role for that sort of actress.
Jessica is known to now be residing somewhere in the state of Virginia.
Melissa plays her role as the psychotic Jennifer excellently.
I love the movie.
The Woman In Black is very atmospheric and dark.
The Woman In Black is fantastic in all aspects.
This film starts off as a reasonably solid and interesting ghost story.
An hilariously accurate caricature of trying to sell a script.
But only in doses does it draw upon tag.
Whenever the camera focuses on the lady in black.
A pale look and those minor mannerisms just seem to haunt you.
This is a plain old spooky ghost story.
The ending is a real twist that caught me unawares.
Well directed and well acted.
I was so impressed I got the book by Susan Hill from Amazon.
The movie follows the book rather closely.
My copy is VHS.
I can understand why this might not appeal to all palates.
Then he brings it all to a ghastly disturbing close.
when it comes to actually scaring people.
All who love a real psychological thriller must see this movie.
it is the best of it is kind.
I'm fascinated by the fact that so many other users have said this too.
but nothing can compare to this.
Comedy Festival Aspen 1999.
Most horror movies are in fact horrible movies.
Subtlety can be more terrifying.
Most viewers would find this to be too slowly paced.
But the slow pacing helps give the story credibility.
The makeup and costume for the ghost are kept simple and believable.
Hollywood would have done an overkill and turned this idea into a mediocrity.
The woman only makes about five appearances in the film.
This is how a really great horror film should be.
and it is a terrible shame that this is out of print.
This film gave me nightmares for months and I'm 17.
You will not forget her once you have seen her.
I first saw this movie here in the U.
in December 1989 when Central TV broadcast it.
The many casual appearances of the ghost really freaked me out.
This is all in the very beginning.
One is eager to learn the meaning of it all.
The Woman In Black is a great TV movie and a lost gem.
This film is the most profoundly terrifying film I have seen.
The story is very interesting and gets your attention since the first minutes.
This one qualifies on all counts.
I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films.
This film has been scaring me since the first day I saw it.
The action keeps the viewer deeply involved and the finale is quite disturbing.
The acting is excellent and the tension is almost unbearable at times.
10 out of 10.
Other players are adequate if not quite as arresting as Emil and Russell are.
Who actually wants to discuss the theories of Relativity.
The vintage costumes and locations of the period all come off fittingly enough.
But I think it is excellent.
Each of them contains the seeds of their own destruction.
Enter Senator McCarthy who thinks Einstein is a Red.
It is a powerful and memorable moment.
Insignificance is one of my top five movies of all time.
It is utterly amazing.
A lovely little B picture with all the usual Joe Lewis touches.
people ripping up pillows and auras of lurking fear.
This is surely his best.
It does not lack crime.
The title character answers an ad.
She is overjoyed that she will be making some money as a secretary.
Only a very strong person could survive such a terrifyingly unsettling ordeal.
And Nina Foch gives the sense of a strong woman as Julia.
Foch has an elegant manner.
Surely the single most fascinating element is the casting of Dame May Witty.
But here she is far from a heroine.
It seems that this famous and brilliant movie was made almost by accident.
Undoubtedly the director knew exactly what he was doing.
But he did it on a low budget.
She became one of the great acting teachers in Los Angeles.
Julia answers an ad for a secretary and is hired immediately by Mrs.
Hughes and her son Ralph.
Hughes and not allowed to leave.
The acting is very good.
Julia obtains the position and is hired by a Mrs.
Hughes and has some very strange desires for playing around with knives.
MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS is a mesmerizing 1945 B thriller from Joseph H.
And very modest resources.
Her predicament makes no sense.
Lewis took a big step toward cult status with this film and understandably so.
Just dark enough to be interesting and light enough to be enjoyed by everyone.
I have downloaded the entire soundtrack at one point or another.
This a real diamond in the rough and not to be missed.
Strongly recommended for all ages from 9 year olds to grannies.
Lovely period piece capturing 1962.
she loves to get the kids and her into silly and sometimes dangerous games.
It is just that good.
This show is just good clean television.
The comparisons to the HAUNTING are superficial.
This was that movie for me.
They just do not make spook films like this one anymore.
and a wickedly ironic ending.
Scared the hell out of me.
Everyone that has spent the night there previously has died.
Steele makes most any film worth seeing.
The story concerns a haunted castle.
The only flaw I see in the movie is the running time.
It almost feels padded.
There is a large portion of the first act where literally nothing happens.
Our hero stumbles around in the dark finding nothing of interest.
I found the movie genuinely creepy and at the same time sorrowful.
Babs Steele is undeniably beautiful.
The music score makes the atmosphere twice as terror inducing.
This film is quite suitable for a rainy day or evening.
the Night of the Dead.
It was the first on the bill.
The film is not without faults.
Clearly some effort was put into its restoration and deservedly so.
This movie does contradict the first.
I will not deny that.
That indecipherable quality tantalizes me into watching it again and again.
The problem with the movie is in its structure.
The compositions are stunning.
You should see it at least once.
See it for yourself to find out the rest of the story.
This film gets very high marks for creating a creepy atmosphere.
The scene where Dr.
I would not hesitate to recommend this film to horror movie lovers.
This begins a wager between Edgar Allen Poe and a journalist.
Overall this is pretty good and in gloomy black and white.
Barbara Steele definitely makes the movie too.
8 out of 10.
Her mere presence turns a creepy ghost story into something truly memorable.
Well executed old and very dark house horror.
Plus we have the delightful and enigmatic Barbara Steele.
The crypt sequence is really eerie and the tension is almost unbearable.
Then the other actors respond in English to what was being said.
The series is lovable because of these puns.
You will be laughing at their own view of heaven.
I would definitely suggest this one for younger children.
There is a totally different side to the Japanese animation.
Even the theme song alone is funny.
You will laugh until your sides hurt.
Another comment about this film made it sound lousy.
Davis was so young and fresh.
She had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect.
My vote is see it and remember how young this type of film was.
The acting is indeed fine in most every respect.
Condensing the gigantic W.
Davis is intense to the point of scary.
But Ms Davis films of 1934 tell quite the opposite.
But even that is not all.
And it was the latter role that launched her among the greatest stars.
The story is simply too big to be told in mere 83 minutes.
Camera movements between the some scenes is also original and refreshing.
Which he just refuses to hear.
The movie may be great.
I do not make this claim lightly.
You just want to shake him.
Her Nora was the woman Philip should have stayed with.
Her Sally did not push her talent to the limits.
The film seems rather dated now in 2003.
It was startling for me to see how young Ms.
Davis looks in this move.
I felt slightly indifferent and detached about the movie after viewing it.
A classic that deserves it reputation.
It gave me the chills for some reason.
Leslie Howard was gorgeous.
He did a great job.
So I bought it.
It was impossible to take her character seriously.
In the other major role was Leslie Howard and he did it superbly.
He was a subtle and intelligent actor The supporting actors acquit themselves well.
And the ending is a real tearjerker.
Of Human Bondage is a fascinating piece of cinema despite its superficial faults.
It also has to be viewed in perspective.
A fine example of his skillful direction is the scene set at Victoria Station.
Davis rose the stardom with her performance.
The motion picture will like to classic cinema buffs.
Thanks to her performance she brings this rather dull movie to life.
This movie is about sexual obsession.
Bette Davis plays Mildred.
This is a woman who men are drawn to.
Now the movie does not come out and say that but it is obvious.
He starts buying her things even pays for her apartment.
Meanwhile she is seeing other people and she makes no secrets of it.
He is constantly thinking about her.
His med school grades are even failing.
He is heart broken but he meets another woman.
They seem fine but it is obvious he is still dreaming of the Bimbo.
Mildred does comes back with a baby and unwed.
Finally Sally and her dad takes him in.
Not before another March of Time montage showing him going downhill.
Meanwhile he finds Mildred needs him again.
I wished she told him to stuff it.
But I feel Phillip was the bad guy.
But in any case he dogs those women waiting for Mildred.
Yes she was not a respectable woman but far from a villain.
Mitchell or Professor Henry Higgins is not one who is betrayed.
He is sensitive for several reasons.
And she finds him an easy meal ticket.
But the performance of Davis as Mildred makes the film important.
Curiously her performance was not all of one note.
Every motion picture Bette Davis stars in is worth experiencing.
Few became great actors.
Her body was so curvy when she was young.
Several features of this film immediately date it.
It is probably construed to send you home with a smile on your face.
Watching her performance is still spellbinding.
She makes the viewer absolutely despise her and pity her at the same time.
I will not deny that.
So this movie was also good for my imagination.
And it is also got great emotional depth to it too.
I used to watch it at least once a week.
Now it is just too bad that they never made a soundtrack available.
Out on the streets with nowhere to go Philip is taken in by Mr.
Of the three remakes on W.
The film is dominated by Mildred from the start.
Bette Davis gives a fantastic portrayal of Mildred.
This was one of her best roles and she ran away with it.
Her disgust toward the kind Philip is clear from the onset of their relationship.
Leslie Howard underplayed Philip and makes him appear even weaker than he is.
All much in the style back then.
The choreography is awesome and the storyline is basic.
but this time around it is lighter and more comedic.
I saw this movie once on late night t.
and knew it was the best movie ever.
The progression of the main character is seamless.
Act One sets up the premise.
Act Two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob.
Act Three is where the fight fest begins.
Than they work to together to save the Care Bears.
This is simply the epitome of what a made for TV movie should be.
The poorly written script.
It has it all.
Everyone involved in its creation deserves a medal.
all of 27 when she made this movie.
But this one is just plain crazy.
Life appears very good.
Both are great fun.
They start a dance school that is soon very successful.
You do not want to mess with her.
This is my favorite of the three care bears movies.
Once again I liked all the songs.
And of course I LOVED the songs.
My favorites being Growing Up and Forever Young.
The care bears movies have always had such good songs.
Ten stars for a very good movie.
The atmosphere is a fine mix of comic and eerie.
Lots of lovely swipes at Hollywood and the terrifying movie tot.
See it and love it.
But still this movie is highly entertaining.
The two stars and Curtis Harrington stylish direction easily overcomes its flaws.
A very strange and compelling movie.
One of the more memorable films I have seen in a long while.
Fantastic performances all around.
I saw it at the Silent Movie Theater here in LA.
My vote is seven.
I always sat down and watched the first one.
As I got older I learned to prefer this one.
I tend to annoy everyone by singing it.
It was really surprising.
I think it is a wonderful movie.
It leaves an effect on you.
Again this movie can teach everyone at all ages about morality.
Romantic comedies are tough movies.
The cast is talented.
And he never looks comfortable in these dopey roles.
But I still miss his work in independent films.
Perhaps the problem lies in the script more than anything else.
This was actually a fun movie.
Jason Lee is good in everything he does.
Selma Blair needs to eat something.
But she still looks beautiful.
Maybe that is one source of disappointment.
I got to say this is one of his good leading roles.
However I do believe his role in Vanilla Sky was better acted.
This movie is all right.
She chooses his clothes and his daily schedule.
And suddenly she turns up everywhere.
It is not only about saving his wedding.
it is about survival.
And he got nice support from beautiful ladies Julia Stiles and Selma Blair.
I enjoyed it very much.
I happened to watch this movie by chance some days ago while flipping channels.
My expectations were not very high but it was an interesting movie.
The movie contains the right mix of comedy and romance.
Definitely worth a watch.
I was worried that my daughter might get the wrong idea.
You can also feel their chemistry between them.
This made the already muddled mystery story even more difficult to keep track of.
The ending at the carnival reminds one of David Lynch almost.
The acting here is also very good.
well it becomes murder mystery of plotted devilment and much shenanigans.
He was and remains a unique force in film.
One can consider whether in an earlier age he would have been a painter.
This film certainly reinforces that impression.
I like the accent.
I love all of his movies and wish there were more.
I particularly love how other actors interacted with him on film.
Watch it and be grateful for the chance.
But I find the story excellent too.
This film is brilliant.
It alone is worth the cost of a rental.
Even the great Mr.
But the credit went to Stevenson.
For five years in Hollywood it was barely a great record.
So the marriage was going on the rocks as well.
It was a wise question.
Certainly it has a curious plot development.
She convinces him to hire Michael as the skipper of their yacht.
Glenn Anders was a leading Broadway performer.
Surely that must count for something.
Pure Orson Welles genius makes this one of the greatest of movies.
That scene alone is worth the price of admission.
No one should miss this picture.
Plenty of eye candy here.
Welles handles that combination of material skillfully as a director.
Welles blocks scenes with skill.
Instead he relies on externals such as accents and fake noses.
What a sad life for such a vibrant beauty.
That he presented himself as a rootless sailor is telling.
This movie is like shrimp in garlic and lemon.
Great camera works and lighting techniques.
He was playing by different rules.
He is also wonderful in a Touch Of Evil.
it is really ignorant.
His direction defines what great direction is.
Check out the courtroom scene.
Usually they are such stock scenes that I can not stand them.
Watch that juror who is always sneezing and interrupting the proceedings.
Or just take a look at the lighting in that scene.
But things do not go to plan.
One wonders why he hires Michael.
She was a brilliant actress when given the chance to show off her talent.
45 bullet through her head.
Several characters as suspects in the mystery.
Instead it was a matter of deliberate caprice by the gods for amusement.
The investment in environment beyond all.
The second Care Bears movie is immensely better than its predecessor.
Critics need to review what they class as a quality movie.
Gotten better with age so to speak.
So far this film is starting to sound a lot like Gilda.
One can only imagine the film Mr.
Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders made an excellent contribution to the movie.
They pop up all over.
I am convinced that this would have been an excellent cut.
Any or all of these items might have inspired the music.
There is no sound atmosphere on the boat.
A little wind and water is sorely missed.
At the start of the picnic sequence.
The Hawaiian guitar music which comes out of the radio.
was supposed to be corny enough to make a certain satirical point.
Nobody in the audience could possibly suspect that we are kidding.
The aquarium scene needs more echo.
The gun battle with the breaking mirrors must not be backed with music.
If you saw the original film you will notice a discrepancy.
The babies are adorable and it is fun watching them play and grow.
The songs are sweet and memorable.
I could not believe how freaking amazing this film was.
It is by far one of the best independent films I have ever seen.
I would recommend it to anyone who loves movies.
In addition the digital photography is the best of the lot so far.
I loved this movie from the opening sequence right through to the end.
I look forward to more offerings from this creative and talented director.
oh lord I hope he gets better and makes plenty of other movies.
the guy knows how to handle a sword and to pull an entertaining massacre.
he is the total package.
it is pretty amazing.
it is pretty straightforward.
Japan is in serious trouble.
My Rating 7 out of 10.
These are the basic premises.
The story begins with a festival in a local town.
From here the story gets interesting.
I was however mistaken in the best possible way.
It becomes a practically theatrical experience which takes your breath away.
Its a horror style play thats been filmed.
It is all in all a solidly great film.
I might just watch it again myself.
An ending which is guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat.
This is a nice piece of work.
Very sexy and engaging enough plot to keep my interest throughout.
and that was funny when she sprayed him in the eye in the store.
sometimes these movies make me mad when people act stupid and do stupid things.
but that is what i think an thought about the movie.
Many suspects in this one.
I have not seen any other movie quite like True Crime.
i mean it is exciting.
I would recommend it to other people.
It comes on Lifetime movie network quite a lot.
I really like her as an actress and person.
She seems so nice and down to earth.
Kevin just seems too sweet for me.
But I think he did okay.
just like she is in real life.
In fact everyone in the cast does a good job .
I reckon her characterization of MG has some mileage in it too.
I can only wonder what happened after such a promising start.
I think it is an entertaining story worth seeing.
While in space he contracted some bizarre and unknown disease.
Just gotta love it for what it is.
It starts off slow and you wonder if there is anything going to happen.
It chills you right to the bone.
Never the less a great ending that begs you to want to know more.
Loved it and well done and thanks for the ride.
never comprehending the race had LONG GONE BY.
but how come he.
The melting guy wanders around killing people.
A very special movie.
The character of Dr.
That sequence with the nurse is simply hilarious.
The climax is especially fun.
Hollywood needs to consider a charming remake of this movie.
My wife and I would go see it.
This movie has Tony Randall at his best.
Too bad Hollywood does not make movies like this anymore.
Most people will never have any use for these.
He sends Tony Randall to check out the situation.
They make a cute couple actually.
I think most would agree that from documentaries we expect enlightenment and authenticity.
eventually after about a week of looking i found it on atom films.
I started off fine.
at the end i pushed back my chair and stood up.
even after the fourth or fifth time its still unsettling.
But the film gets high marks for a fun script and decent acting.
Many critics have felt offended that R.
They are mutually related.
They are both good in different ways.
she was more believably sweet and sentimental.
This is the best Emma in existence in my opinion.
The 1996 movie with G.
Both versions are very good but I prefer this one.
i really loved this version of Emma the best.
the only complaint that i had was on Mr.
she was a smart girl in the end though.
I have lost count of the number of versions going around.
Mark Strong did a fabulous job.
Emma must show that she accepts this now.
She is a changed woman.
I will buy into it.
just as I would have imagined her.
I believe that when the UK does a Jane Austen its the best.
American versions of English literature are done for money and not for quality.
I was always borderline with the other Emma.
It seems put on.
Sorry but do not think Toni and Gwenneth did a brilliant job there.
It is definitely the version I will come back to from now on.
I also love the new scene at the end.
The setting and costumes were beautiful.
She is snobbish but has just enough youth and inexperience to be still likable.
A strange departure from the faithfulness otherwise shown throughout the film.
For me this production was and remains a delight.
The film also marks the beginning of the series featuring the Hardy family.
Lionel Barrymore plays Judge Hardy with conviction.
He is the glue that holds everything together.
This is a excellent start to the film career of Mickey Rooney.
His talents here shows that a long career is ahead for him.
The car and truck chase is exciting for the 1937 era.
This start of the Andy Hardy series is an American treasure in my book.
I think it would be a winner.
Her name is Fanny and she is interviewed here.
The film makers make the film more than just another documentary.
Recently more and more documentaries have been making it to cinemas.
But this one as to be amongst the best.
I used to borrow the books from the school library every chance I got.
Seven young people go to the forest looking for a bear.
Soon they are all stalked and viciously murdered by a crazy Vietnam veteran.
However if you are a fan of slasher movies give this rarity a look.
My brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie.
So there must be something.
10 out of 10.
The forestry setting and particularly the camouflaged booby traps are joyously spectacular.
The film launches in the somewhat unfamiliar territory of a pistol duel.
All this talk about this being a bad movie is nonsense.
As a matter of fact this is the best movie I have ever seen.
I would not give criticism to any of the actors.
That movie is the best and it will always stay that way.
Full of profound emotions from every angle.
Irons deserved an award for his performance and Close was never better.
And this something was the most important part.
i would give each actor an Oscar.
i wish the movie received more awards.
the story was beautiful and sad at the same time.
He makes so many mistakes but gets a chance for redemption.
Many people here utterly dislike this movie.
I can not understand that one single bit.
This movie is an incredible piece of work.
Stellar performances all around.
This one had me weeping for about half an hour straight.
Spend some real time with this one.
Esteban is find enough.
The way the plot was constructed with the ending mirroring the beginning was great.
What is told is told fairly well.
The acting is excellent.
The film is based entirely on a pair of hapless lovers.
Beautifully filmed and acted.
Reveals an area of Paris which is alive and filled with comedy and tragedy.
This movie is dear to the French movies buffs for another very special reason.
What saves this plot is its connection with the story of M.
She does not appear to cause such a curiosity while talking.
Garbo was very good in American film and she is also very good here.
Even William Daniels cinematography seems improved over his filming of the Brown version.
This version of Anna Christie is in German.
Both were filmed back to back because Garbo had such a following in Germany.
Garbo herself supposedly favored her Anna Christie in this version over the English version.
this is a great movie.
then you see him chanting poems as he ran to escape the wolves.
So the main theme is the guy trying to save the beautiful ghost.
And I'm looking forward to watching the first sequel of this movie also.
If there is a movie to be called perfect then this is it.
Go find it somewhere.
This is one of the reasons people rave about Hong Kong cinema.
Entertainment at it is peak.
Just read the original story which is written by Pu in 18th century.
The result is pure beauty.
The film has some wonderful visuals and amazing fights.
I love especially the fight scene between Wu Ma and the tree demon tongue.
Not to repeat other reviews here.
The score is very good and moving.
Recommend everybody to see it.
The filmmakers have crafted a movie that appeals to every horror fan.
The story is engrossing and original.
The villains are appropriately menacing and frightening.
The sets are creepy and atmospheric.
This film easily fits into many different categories.
This film offers something for every film fan.
Her portrayal of the title character is truly haunting and memorable.
Wu Ma is hilarious as the cantankerous Taoist who aids the young lovers.
The direction is superb.
The cinematography is gorgeous.
Enough good things can not be said about this film.
Find a copy anywhere you can.
The art set decoration and other aesthetic facets are all mesmerizing.
More fantastically the movie had a total black humorous undertone in it.
The climax is like a mirror of Miranda Otto fighting with the Ring Witch.
I like the good and evil battle.
I liked Eddie in this movie better than any movie he has ever done.
He shows heart and a more humble humor.
A beautiful story that truly pays attention to details.
I saw this movie in my childhood.
My all times favorite movie.
I follow this movie.
The story about the power of love is pretty touching and warm.
A beautiful story that truly pays attention to details.
Some of the special effects may seem outdated compared to modern standards.
This minor flaw is easily ignored.
There is so much to discover in this story.
The romantic relation between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts.
The visuals are beautiful too.
This movie is incredible.
The final showdown is specially breathtaking and the music score is kinda cool.
Not for the smallest children though.
This one deserves a 10.
My pal Steve Parkhouse recorded it on VHS and sent it to me.
The crew of cinematographers have also done miracles.
This is a film where every shot is an expertly crafted painting.
From the opening song onwards the music becomes as important as the characters.
The score is a perfect mixture of modern and traditional instruments.
And we of course have the acting talent.
She is the epitome of ethereal beauty.
But later it is shown in all its crazy glory.
A true team effort that has given us a truly ground breaking movie.
that should tell you something.
I saw when I was a child and I have a good memory.
I think the end is very worth sticking around.
She targets him and decides he will do nicely.
He is all too eager to be eaten up by the young beauty.
Hysteria and fear take over from cool calculation and cunning.
It appears to be England.
Corny plot and in many cases terrible acting.
Yet the movie is so juicy and so suspenseful.
More faithful to the book than most movies of its era.
Joan Fontaine stars as the villain in this Victorian era film.
Marshall is quite good as Miles.
It takes an actress with extraordinary talent to pull that off.
I highly recommend this film.
I watched this film and then Jane Eyre right after.
she just keeps getting better.
My heart was racing.
Great old movie drama.
Just what i want from a classic movie.
Facial expressions are worth the whole film.
I'm glad i have it on video.
The costumes are very nice.
Whenever they try they just seem to make a cheesy movie.
Films in black and white still hold a certain mystery.
A strange role for Eddie Murphy to take at the height of his career.
The sets look phony.
So we have here a flawed but very interesting version.
The Sea is Watching was an interesting film experience.
It was obvious what we were to look at in each frame.
The physicality of the set itself contributed to that feeling of smallness and intensity.
Maybe we just miss the eye of the master.
To expect that might well be very silly.
This is a very fine and poetic story.
It goes deep into your feelings without becoming melodramatic.
This should help clear up some details which may be confusing to the unaware.
You will not be disappointed.
I recommend this film to all that love a epic period piece.
They are not accurate on this film.
Eddie Murphy really shines in his roll.
You can sit down with your whole family and everybody will enjoy it.
I recommend this movie to everybody to see.
It is a comedy with a touch of fantasy.
This movie takes you from L.
lowest of the low.
The movie deserves a higher rating.
It is a tale of survival of women in feudal Japan.
the strong ones while women were thought to be just mindless and weak property.
Each has a reason for turning to the life of geisha.
The sea is watching and will find protection for true love.
My boyfriend and I both enjoyed this film very much.
A tragically wonderful movie.
brings us to a Japan that does not exist anymore.
The characters are full of depth and act with much intensity.
I can understand those who dislike this movie cause of a lack of knowledge.
I did greatly enjoy the art direction and the acting.
The film was full of beautiful touches.
the courtroom scene itself.
with the couple copulating in the cage while the heroine pleads for their orgasm.
I have not seen this movie in 20 years.
but it made indelible pictures in my mind.
especially when you are 17 and have a constant hard on.
This movie was good for it is time.
This was one of her first movies and she was not bad.
I loved the the film.
Out with the old and in with the new.
She brings to mind a New Yorker cartoon of a few years ago.
They have to carry it and they do.
I found the film compelling.
She is realistic settings and atmospheres.
As usual it was inevitable the usual negative comments.
Before you read the review already knew what was the final judgment.
In the film a good gift because 10 is really well done.
then comes the noises and the loud pounding from the apartment upstairs at night.
And the sinister new neighbors soon become more than a little bothersome to Alice.
The flashback scenes are what really made it for me.
The ending I consider to be one of the finest in Horror history.
The Sentinel has the perfect build up of tension.
We are never fully comfortable whenever Allison is on screen.
It will give you the thrills and scares you need to be satisfied.
Well worth the look.
Time has not been kind to this movie.
This falls on her in atonement for her attempted suicide earlier in her life.
The cast was competent.
The damned souls at the end are portrayed by actual sideshow freaks and geeks.
Whoever thought to do that was a twisted but brilliant genius.
It remains a strangely compelling and entertaining dip into the realm of evil.
the Brooklyn Queens Expressway.
This happens to be one of my favorite horror films.
Burgess Meredith is delightful as the lovably insane neighbor.
There is almost no gore.
The direction is quite spartan.
but perhaps I have said too much already.
I highly recommend you not watch it alone.
Whoever was the casting director for this film deserves some sort of prize.
8 out of 10.
The end scene is repulsive and yet chilling.
Unfortunately there are no extras beyond a trailer that looks pretty worse for wear.
Alison Parker is a model with some fame.
Alison realizes that she is living in the gateway to hell.
Yesterday I saw this movie once more.
The creepy and lurid story frightens even in the present days.
The cast is a constellation of stars and starlets.
My vote is nine.
The first time you see The Second Renaissance it may look boring.
Look at it at least twice and definitely watch part 2.
It will change your view of the matrix.
and thus the populace has become lazy and derogatory towards them.
I would say it does a great job of that.
The plot is good.
Thus it holds clips from fictional news reports and the like.
Japan makes some of the best animation in the world.
Sadly most of these shorts are disappointing.
The Second Renaissance is made as a historical file.
It tells how humans made machines in their own likeness.
The machine does not have a fair trial and riots start around the world.
The governments of the world order to dismantle machines.
The short also has some religious themes and religious iconography.
Seeing themselves as the rightful masters of the machines.
He is willing to use violence and know how to keep a story going.
But its a good watch.
Plus it needs to be seen with part two to be complete.
This is the perfect method to reveal the history.
It was a lot of fun working for and with R.
Harlin and wished I had a chance to do it again.
Or at least that is what you would have thought.
I give it 3.
A very entertaining horror film with some very nice touches indeed.
The film is not exactly original but the plot line is interesting.
We focus on a prison that has been reopened after a number of years.
It looks creepy as all empty and filled with prisoners.
We are given some character depth and several of the prisoners are interesting characters.
Chelsea Field is okay as the female lead.
But these scenes are visually creative and interesting.
The acting is uniformly decent.
The script actually much more cohesive than one usually gets from films like these.
It seems that the time for vengeance has finally arrived.
even though these are genuinely unsettling as well.
Lane Smith is deliciously wicked as the guilty warden.
This atmospheric and very moody film features lots of gruesome gore and violence.
I was amused throughout and laughed out loud plenty of times.
And made tonnes more money.
Time to end this review.
I love this movie like no other.
The movie captivates your attention for every second.
This movie really kicked some ass.
I watched it over and over and it never got boring.
This movie lived up to what I had hoped for.
Like I said its a hidden surprise.
It well written well acted and well cast.
I liked everything in this movie.
Look its Hollywood all right but the brighter side.
Well worth a look.
And it is a role he plays well.
Timothy Hutton plays a fine villain and Angelina Jolie pouts.
Drug addiction and a desire for the sultry Jolie mix a heady cocktail.
This film has a lot of raw potential.
In the end he just tries too hard.
Angelina Jolie was also really good.
I enjoyed this movie.
Very unfair to say the least.
By sheer accident he becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire Raymond Blossom.
However the FBI take an interest in using Eugene to snare Blossom.
She puts in a solid performance.
Timothy Hutton playing Blossom is superb and immersed himself deeply into his character.
I love this film.
It is well written and acted and has good cinematography.
Great cast all together.
A must see for people bored with the same old action movie.
I gave it 8 stars.
For a first film in a proposed series it achieves the right balance.
I'm looking forward to the next film.
This is what I do with books that I like as well.
What I got was a movie not based on action or violence.
The director had focused on history and psychology.
almost boring and unreal.
The acting could have been improved too.
And please forgive me for my bad English.
For me they were totally credible.
When looking at it again I must say it is actually pretty OK.
The script and direction provide some gems.
The first point I like to make is that this is slightly wrongfully classified.
It is one of the greatest adventure comic strips of all time.
I enjoyed this film.
However this is acceptable just to get such a faithful version.
Positive surprised of this story about Modesty and her childhood.
So I may have overrate this movie just a little.
I have seen this movie and I must say I'm very impressed.
I fancy to see this again.
Action fused with a fantastic story.
The bad boy is pretty too.
The movie does not introduce Willie Garvin or Sir Gerald.
What this movie accomplishes is showing the strength of the character by herself.
The film does not come across as cheap.
I first saw this movie on television some years ago and frankly loved it.
Charles Dance makes one of the most terrifying villains anyone can imagine.
His sophistication is such a perfect contrast to the crudely good hero.
I loved it when I first saw it and I love it still.
I suspect it might not do that well in the USA in general distribution.
She has lots of closeups.
What we have here is a step or two better than that.
I just hope they do better on that if and when they make sequels.
I used to watch this show when I was a little girl.
I vaguely remember the theme song.
No such scenes are present or needed.
Short synopsis This film opens with soldiers being released from the company of men.
One of them pursues another with a weird scheme the other repeatedly refuses.
It is also very stylish.
The wardrobe is also very good.
Both do a considerable amount of acrobatics.
And it is certainly the man himself we hear.
He is the best brainy police inspector I know.
No such scenes are present or needed.
Michael Ritchie and Eddie Murphy fit the bill for this capacity just fine.
My advice to you is to buy the ticket and take the ride.
Losing Algiers was a bitter blow.
I definitely recommend reading the book prior to watching the film.
Having grown up in Melbourne I could really relate to this book and movie.
Those that rent the movie based on this description will only be disappointed.
This is what I like about it.
But the glamorous and sultry Ms.
For the first half of the movie the little girl grated on my nerves.
I do not think this is one of her best acting jobs.
The story is based on true events and that helps the movie.
It is a great movie.
i just saw this movie on TV.
i can feel the lost that the little girl Desi felt.
the feeling of wanting to see her father again.
wanting to talk to him.
or at least given the chance to say goodbye.
it just lets me feel that miracles do exist.
There is an intense scene or two in this.
I recommend this to fans of these types of movies.
The little girl Desi is so adorable.
I cant think of a more beautiful story then this one here.
Great cast and an overall great movie.
with a little help of it is friends.
It has a great cast.
My family and I have viewed this movie often over the years.
There are no downsides to this sweet human story.
What a lovely heart warming television movie.
Her mother is also very distressed .
only a miracle can alleviate their unhappiness.
The film is based on a true story which makes it so touching.
James Robson Glasgow Scotland U.
This is a great movie.
It is based on a true story.
I loved this movie.
This was one of the most popular with all our customers.
i can see why they have 3 nominations.
you can find mermaid at all blockbuster video stores.
This is the way a proper horror movie should be.
I think the reason it was so scary was because it was so realistic.
The spooky sounding score was perfect for setting a dark mood.
The special effects were very good.
I would love to see more horror movies like this one.
Other then that it had all the elements a good horror movie needs.
I will be adding it to my collection.
It will keep you completely off balance.
I screamed out loud two or three times during the show.
The sound was particularly great and the setting was really creepy beautiful.
For some reason that makes this even stranger for me.
but I will tell you something now.
They decide to move away and rent a cabin looking thing in the mountains.
to cut a long story short.
Dark Remains is a home run plain and simple.
The couple is not doing well.
the sign behaves like an object.
This movie was very good.
Allan was very good and I thought the cinematography was amazing.
It offers some genuine scares and plenty of tension.
The acting is fairly good and the cinematography is great.
7 out of 10.
it is just done well.
This is not a movie to watch while you are eating pizza.
something that is rather rare nowadays.
and most of them suck.
a few are watchable.
even fewer are actually good.
Dark Remains is one of the good ones.
I caught a screening of this film at the South Padre Island Film Festival.
the audience loved it.
the film looks fantastic.
the acting totally works for the film.
the story is good.
Well worth the rental.
I also enjoyed the projection of people on a back screen.
Same with the scene when Katharina finds her father dead in the bathtub.
you can only see the red water on the side.
The use of black comedy in this film was well done.
God Help us for what we have done.
I feel sorrow for the people affected.
They deserve justice and their homes back.
No one is above the law.
but makes no suggestion of how to help.
Instead they chose to effect the wholesale forcible removal of the native population.
This is a very good movie.
It always comes down to race.
This is an excellent movie.
Pay no attention to the racist.
I recommended everyone to go see this movie.
This is a very dramatic and suspenseful movie.
There are many plots and turns.
Strong performance of Sean Connery and Ed Harris.
Ed Harris was the real gem in the film.
not a bad place to start.
This is a great film and should be seen.
I really enjoyed it.
I like a good mystery.
and this one had me guessing up to the end.
Sean Connery did a good job.
Lars Von Trier is never backward in trying out new techniques.
Some of them are very original while others are best forgotten.
He depicts postwar Germany as a nightmarish train journey.
It is not a simple task as he quickly finds out.
His job is to attend to the needs of the passengers.
When the shoes are polished a chalk mark is made on the soles.
There are many allusions to the German fanaticism of adherence to such stupid details.
He returns to his cabin and makes a connection to a time clock.
Quite ridiculous in fact.
It could only happen in a dream.
The bomb scene described above really put me off.
Perhaps I'm a realist.
Keep your boots on for the strange turnaround at the end of the movie.
I really liked this film.
The surprising turn of plot at the end makes it interesting.
I gave it 7 of 10.
To fight against the death penalty is a just cause.
Everyone who is sane in Europe would think so.
In the USA everything is different.
But the film has a sequel.
Justice in the USA is entirely governed by the aim of vengeance.
Miscarriage of justice is just the same governed by vengeance.
He hides his shame and swears to get his vengeance.
Only God can take the life of a person away.
If vengeance is pushed aside there is no other justification for this death penalty.
I'm going to give a simple review for the normal moviegoers out there.
I thought the casting was perfect.
I was riveted throughout this movie.
If you like mystery thrillers then this definitely a movie you want to see.
To say that all is not what it seems is to put it mildly.
The cast uniformly turns in some good performances.
Of course the reverse is equally true.
I guess if Just Cause has a moral that would probably be it.
That the black police detective Lt.
Tanny Brown of the small community is corrupt and villainously mean.
Is unfettered from prison and eludes his horrific punishment.
Whom he immensely detests.
He just merely struck a bargain with fiendish psycho Sullivan.
To get loose so he could kill again for revenge.
Now Sullivan is executed to his death.
A good thriller that works.
Delivers both mystery and subterfuge.
How reluctant blacks are hazed by racist lawmen.
Sentenced to unfair penalties.
Underwood and Harris are over the top and invigorating as the malevolent psychos.
Ruby Dee is great as the tenacious grandmother.
The rest of the cast is wonderful as well.
This movie really is a mixed bag.
Maybe Sean Connery was miscast in his role.
His performance alone is already more than enough reason to watch this movie.
We feel horrified by what the officers do to the prisoner.
Things are not exactly what we thought they were.
Perhaps had they shown flashbacks or something.
I do not understand this type of criticism.
Books and films are different media.
This TV movie was charming.
I would never have guessed she was 40 when she made this film.
I also think it is about the best thing Reeves ever did.
I found this movie to be charming.
This is a period piece that I believe took place during the depression.
He sees the ad and he goes out to see her.
Everything went on so matter of fact.
They dance around the fact that they begin to really need each other.
Things start warming up until .
I will not spoil it by telling you what happens.
But the point of resolution is perfectly wonderful.
I love this film.
When the penny finally drops his face is a picture.
A bona fide low budget classic.
I have always treasured this film.
Which brings me to an introduction to the characters I liked best.
This film is as good as it is difficult to find.
Give this film a chance and listen to what it says.
because they HAVE been making the same car since 1986.
The film is five years old and rings more true every day.
I think it is a very good film.
This movie packs a lot of story into a very short time.
I found the music a real treat.
A total trashy treat.
com and some retail stores such as Best Buy.
The whole thing seemed rushed and kind of forced.
Preston Waters is off to a bad summer.
His father confines him to his room for the rest of the evening.
Now the three have to track Preston down.
He makes this person up named Mr.
Miguel Ferrer plays his role very good.
He does all sorts of wicked crazy things.
I mean how whacked out is this.
Walt Disney really outdid themselves this time.
The comedy is most of the times expected but the other times unexpected.
I mean was this movie OK or was this movie OK.
But also it sucks.
That kid is really lucky.
Back to the story.
The acting was good and bad.
The special effects on the other hand was lame.
I hated and loved it at the same time.
This is a good movie.
This movie was one of my favorites during my childhood.
This is an excellent little film about the loneliness of the single man.
They try various nightclubs and places but all to no avail.
One is enough for any man.
But ultimately it is a very beautiful and deeply moving film.
Yet it is extremely relevant to society and everybody.
This depressing movie is only suitable for an informed audience.
But these are failings of the movie but conscious choices.
Acting was very good.
Story had a unique and interesting arrangement.
The absence of violence and sex was refreshing.
Characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings.
This concert is just shear brilliance from start to finish.
Jack Bruce just great.
I do not agree with that.
I have no complaints.
The concert sounded very good.
Steven Ford was very likable.
More importantly Helen Hunt caught my eye.
Sure I liked Twister and As Good As It Gets.
I would now see myself as a huge fan.
This movie comes with high marks from.
My vote is nine.
Getting a job at the Mr.
Put back on undercover duty by her boss Capt.
I really wish it was on d.
Helen Hunt gave such a raw performance.
She played a rookie cop thrown into serial killer case perfectly.
When she falls apart because he kills another kid it was amazing.
It was a real thriller without being gory.
The acting performances were great and the script was equally great.
Gina was a complex character.
She was a rookie cop with the Riverside Police Dept.
The entire movie was spectacular.
This movie was a good example of doing a lot with little.
More TV movies ought to be made like this one.
This film really increased my respect for Hunt as an actress.
I ALWAYS watch it again.
NEVER turning the channel.
Reading the earlier comments persuaded me to give it a shot.
8 WHO'S STATISTICAL AVERAGE was 7.
3 It must be a sure hit.
I gave it a 9.
One of the better movies released.
Space Cobra himself is witty and likable.
Check out if you can.
This film is a great fun.
I recommend you watch it yourself and then watch it again with your friends.
But they all thanked me and loved the movie.
group where everyone trusts everyone else.
He was evil with a great laugh and a great smile on his face.
But I do not want to give anything away.
This should be a international classic for all time.
I believe all great movies eventually rise to the top.
Time will be very good to this film.
The director and editor were fantastic.
They deserved winning the best documentary.
He has been chided for calling himself one of the best working directors.
I tend to agree with him.
He simply is the Bergman or Fellini of our time.
It is too bad the critics are too intrigued with themselves to notice this.
I think that is the point.
He even laughs when a character is given a really silly and trite line.
Not a good choice for the little ones.
Beat a path to this important documentary that looks like an attractive feature.
On a single watching your sense of narrative becomes mired.
so I watched it twice.
At some point the filmmaker came to the same conclusion.
What a fascinating film.
But the twists and turns she takes the documentary maker through are amazing.
and then put back together again.
She refuses to return to Jordan and show us the facts.
The result is an incredible look inside the mind of a con artist.
The movie is neither unduly sympathetic nor dismissive of the natives.
Be there at ten.
EUROPA also gets accused of historical incorrectness.
It should not be that terribly hard to escape.
The screenplay is very original and the story is spoken in Tupi.
My vote is eight.
I love this movie very much i watched it over and over.
Maybe you have seen better or whatever it is i personally love it.
This film is a very good movie.
The way how the everybody portrayed their roles was great.
The story is nice.
She later becomes pregnant.
But shortly their is a problem.
Sadly they wont get the child.
She later becomes pregnant but she is not married to him.
The movie is very good.
The songs are melodious to listen.
The cinematography is excellent.
The cast makes the movie great to watch.
Worth the money and time.
which are required to make a movie hit.
Later when she too turns out thoughtful about her life she deserve proper attention.
But still then it is a doubt.
The cinematography was unfortunately bad.
There is no doubt she is more talented than her industry contemporaries.
She just should do more such roles.
But the plot has it is number of clichés.
There are some very little plot holes.
Otherwise the whole family sequence felt overdone in the beginning.
Over here he gave one of the best performances.
Its surprising how she can be just as convincing when she is innocent.
This role is one of the reasons why I rate her high.
The songs are pretty nice.
1 Punjabi came across boring though it had good dancing.
Otherwise the movie is definitely worth a watch.
The only information given was that it was a suspense thriller.
The main plot is to do with surrogacy and is well handled.
this kept from her and the rest of the family.
They get married and go to Switzerland for their honeymoon.
Raj finds a girl.
She is a dancer and a prostitute.
Raj tells her the situation and bribes her with money and she agrees.
They go to Switzerland to do this so no one finds out.
They are happy again.
It was still excellent.
The songs of the film are great.
This film was Europa.
Required viewing if you admire Martin Scorsese and his work.
I wish everyone took a page from his love of movies.
People have no clue what ideas are being explored in their favorite movies.
He evaluate his stylistic sensibilities along with the directors of the sequences themselves.
This dictates the structure for the documentary.
I was enthralled through the whole thing and you will be too.
She also adopted Anne Shirley as her stage name.
Tom Brown was an excellent Gilbert Blythe.
Von Trier brilliantly paints his vision on screen.
Which transformed the basic genre from mildly amusing family drama to comedy.
A change that delighted audiences and that continues to frustrate reader purists.
Australian character actor O.
Never viewed this film and consider it a great Classic with great veteran actors.
This season was the one that was most about actual business skills.
Brent was just an embarrassment and obviously only there to create drama.
New York will always be the place for this.
The tasks were terrible and Trump also chose the wrong winner.
Never has anyone dominated a season like he did.
And they certainly do not reveal any hidden agendas.
The road to success is not easy.
The group is divided into two teams that compete against each other.
Others may involve selling at a retail outlet or on the street.
The tasks bring out the best and worst in the participants.
And sometimes more than one person gets fired.
No one should sacrifice their integrity for this.
I have seen losing teams sometimes appearing better organized than the winning team.
But the best part of the show is New York city.
But just like the amazing race this show is always best watched in moderation.
You enjoy seeing them get screwed although its totally wrong and sick.
The amount of tears also seems to be increasing by the season.
Watch with caution and maintain a conscience.
Those are your fellow human beings in the firing line.
The TV series was much better.
So thanks to this Puppet Master is going to be a big hit.
Then buy the poster and hang it on your wall.
The soundtrack is highly recommendable too.
This movie is brilliant.
This movie is an underground hit and brings comparisons to Absolutely Fabulous.
If you watch Party Girl you are bound to have a good time.
It is comforting to see a female slacker develop into a mature woman.
Repeated viewings are a must.
This movie is FUN.
I have always thought that she bears some resemblance facially to Katharine Hepburn.
I gave this movie an 8.
But it is incredibly charming and entertaining.
This movie is a great way for the series to finally end.
Personally I wish Puppet Master Vs.
And the movie was pretty good also.
but it all WORKS.
We should all be so lucky.
She is the whole picture.
The rest of the cast is good.
The public library vs.
academic library argument is a classic argument waged among librarians and library school students.
It also breaks many librarian stereotypes.
A French film Ester Williams would love.
Frogs sit on water lilies.
The frog and water lily have a parasitic relationship.
Physical beauty is a currency.
The French are long on paradoxes and short on consistency.
No wonder Francois is always sniffing after her.
This is of course a tricky topic.
Not that you should expect this to be a soft porn movie.
Let me give an example.
Adele is the girl the others envy.
She brags unashamedly about her expertise in fellatio.
Being less special Anne is more truly accessible to the boys.
He was excellent the most enjoyable part of the film.
I suggest you give it a go.
But it is watchable.
The strong individual characters provide the movie with some nice themes and good moments.
A good movie on its subject.
The film reverses some conventional stereotypes about sexuality.
I must confess that I do not quite understand this title.
It is no different for boys.
Much of the movie is water ballet.
This seems to be their first contact that is not just ordinary.
Soon they will walk together.
I took for granted that the couple slept with each other.
But we will later learn from the movie that they do less than that.
I can supply some information which few users will find elsewhere.
And Marie proceeds to eat the rest.
Marie says she can not do this.
But still later Marie says that she is indeed willing to do it.
There is no nudity in this scene.
This story is told at a slow pace and that works very well.
Everyone is completely believable.
7 out of 10 synchronous swimmers.
Three teenage girls in an incomplete triangular relation.
The base of the triangle is barely there.
She is deeply involved in the sport of synchronized swimming performing at competitive level.
Marie sees her during a competition at the local public swimming pool.
Marie is not phased out by that reputation.
Put a stress on reputation.
The first half is set up.
This one is no exception.
Here it is about ceilings and the dying.
See the film to learn more.
The director says that the use of synchronized swimming is purposeful.
The music is perfect and the acting is amazing.
The camera works beautifully also.
it is probably one of the best roles he ever had in a feature.
the musical score is very good.
the story DOESN'T make sense.
BUT THAT ONLY MAKES IT ALL THE MORE INTRIGUING.
He has never been a very interesting film actor.
The best part of this movie is the writing and the wit.
The use of Spanish gives it more authenticity.
I thought it was fun and interesting and worth a 7 at least.
Kirk beams down and finds the others reporting similarly bizarre happenings and encounters.
I watched SHORE LEAVE the other day.
Which makes me think.
MAYBE she was one of the teachers at the academy.
Yeoman Barrows seems to be filling in for Yeoman Rand.
Considering how much attention Dr.
Spock could do that.
Good comedy and mystery thriller at the same time.
As for me it is unacceptable.
and I have some idea.
I know that Lars likes to experiment.
only this way it is possible to make actors alive again.
The most important thing now is the story.
or even to see just the script.
I'm curious how the story ends.
bring an art house style film mainstream.
Jane Fonda was unable to hide her braininess enough to make her character believable.
The acting overall was above average compared to most slasher films.
But what is shown is decent enough to make Hollow Man an entertaining movie.
The first two acts are so good that the slasher final act disappoints.
HOLLOW MAN is one of the better horror films of the past decade.
Kevin Bacon proves again that he can handle any role that comes his way.
One of the most thrilling horror films ever.
The action is intense and the chills are true.
All of whom do an exceptional job.
But someone has to be the subject.
The second half is exciting and appealing to most action and horror fans.
Think of DEEP BLUE SEA.
Then change the sharks into an crazy invisible man.
And then change the water into fire and explosions.
A rehashing of a killer shark movie.
Most of the first tries ended up unstable.
So he ends up being one mad invisible killer.
I would care less about the ones who did you wrong.
Hollow Man starts as brilliant but flawed scientist Dr.
The script by Andrew W.
This is a great fun nasty movie.
Now his mission is to make them visible again.
There are scares and chills and the movie moves at a nice pace.
Normally I do not like series at all.
Greetings again from the darkness.
But their nighttime battle against the lions is thrilling.
Some of the underwater shots are breathless.
The most amazing scenery for me was the breathtaking views of the Himalayas.
I had never seen such detail of the vastness of the range.
Walt Disney Studios has had a monopoly on the animated circuit for decades now.
These real things make a real movie experience.
There have been a few other nature documentaries that also excelled in these categories.
Three production companies were required to make this amazing documentary film.
There are many stunningly beautiful shots in this documentary.
This film should be required viewing in all schools throughout the world.
Without hesitating a 10 out of 10.
EARTH is a must see for children and adults.
My son had great fun watching all these funny birds and ice bears.
There are some animals in danger to disappear.
Exactly that problem should prevent all the authorities of our planet.
This documentary offers many exceptional pictures that I have never seen before.
Then it is well accompanied by a heavenly music.
The director did a great job here that gets high respect.
Nothing can stop me and my family to give EARTH the highest rate.
I hope so much that the stuff will create a sequel.
This movie taught me that we are not only living on the earth.
There is almost no plot in this film.
There was also almost no science in the film at all.
So much for science.
What we saw was pristine.
These are as much Earth as anything else.
We are predators ourselves.
On to the presentation itself.
That repeated about three times.
Much more is revealed and the ending just leaves you begging for more.
This documentary makes you travel all around the globe.
It contains rare and stunning sequels from the wilderness.
It shows you how diversified and how fragile our planet can be.
This documentary is however a simplistic approach of such a serious environmental issue.
It can nonetheless be easily seen by young children since it mainly remains descriptive.
In any case he has a nice enough and calm voice for it.
No blood is shed.
It was the first time I ever cried in a nature film.
The best thing you can do on earth is not miss Earth.
Rather annoying that reviewers keep comparing this to Planet Earth.
But that is not comparing like with like.
All reviewers agree on that.
But as works of art they are not in competition here people.
The Earth is big enough for both.
The camera techniques are varied and spot on from close ups to aerial work.
Eventually it all gets a bit bitty and disjointed.
I loved the way EARTH is made.
Nature simply seems too impressive to comprehend.
This is simply the most astonishing movie you will ever see.
Sometimes both at the same time.
This movie should be shown obligatory in schools.
Kept my attention from start to finish.
Great performances added to this tremendous film.
But it turns out that nothing that he does will really have any effect.
Certainly one that I encourage you to see.
CITY HALL is a somewhat mixed bag.
This series do not seem to be quite as serious as the first one.
This story involves a lot more comedy that the previous.
The actors are the same with some addition to the regular cast.
They are all very good.
Much of the good qualities from the first series are kept intact.
The cinematography is one of those qualities.
Be prepare to see better effect in this sequel that in the first.
Also be prepared to see some more.
All over I would say effects are from OK to good.
The music is also quite good.
Some of it are really touching.
It fits really nice.
All together this makes a good sequel.
It has many of the same qualities as the first series.
These two makes up a series you do not wanna miss.
Here the story became implausible.
As New York Mayor John Pappas in City Hall.
And the power behind power.
or rather who else.
There is just something brilliant about his entire demeanor.
Maybe he was having an off film.
Martin Landau makes a decent cameo as Judge under scrutiny Walter Stern.
A decent movie but unfortunately potential loss.
The film concerns a classic theme.
That is not typical of New York.
That is true in any mayoral office.
Santos and Tito ending up getting shot and killed by each other.
Much is made by everyone of bureaucratic knowledge passed down through the generations.
His advisers tell him he will not be wanted there.
And this is a political thriller as good as they get.
There are no good guys and no bad guys.
There are bad people.
But they come across effectively without crossing the line.
A film like this restores my jaded faith in Hollywood.
I do not award many tens.
It requires actual mental participation on the part of the viewer.
What a nice change.
I WILL say that City Hall requires a whole lot more concentration.
It just so happens to open in New York.
He may come off as annoying if you can not stand this dialect.
Bridget Fonda was good but not memorable.
This was one of the few problems with the film.
but he is very diverse and pretty eccentric.
Both qualities show in this.
The characters are developed further.
and still handing in such a strong performance.
But this does have shortcomings.
the ones the first part had and more.
from which he could see his beloved Sweden.
With an angle from inside the bowl.
I have seen this movie about 6 times now.
Its like watching a train wreck being set in motion.
The story mushrooms and at the end it is reached inside City Hall itself.
But City Hall does not do neither of the above mentioned.
As far as characters go I would say this movie is a solid average.
And there is good acting here.
Documentaries of this kind are often very opinionated.
This film however was mesmerizing.
I wish everyone could see it.
Outstanding and highly recommended.
Need to see more documentaries like this.
Kudos to all of those involved in the making of this film.
10 per hour to do so.
It is simply amazing.
company that imports and sells the beads.
I mean a total discourse on the film viewing experience.
You may wonder how the Marx Brothers come into play.
For the theater goer it is irrelevant.
This is the most fundamental idea of Critical Theory.
I really enjoyed the energetic tone of the narration and the effort of Mr.
And the film list is long.
but these I suspect are baits.
I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival.
Which is not to say that his theories are not provocative.
He stands in front of us and calls himself a pervert.
I guess I will have to research it and let ya know.
Of course the states could have been changed to protect the innocent.
But then a mysterious admirer sets her eyes on Jim.
She constantly harasses Jim through phone calls and letters.
There is a twist at the end.
Trashy but everyone likes trash.
The best film about marriage and family.
The screenplay is wonderful.
This film was a relative blockbuster by domestic Italian standards.
Hope this comment works for you.
The movie it did worked well for me.
I hope it gets distributed as it should.
Congratulations on the cast and director.
Overall the film is OK.
There are a few scenes that makes me touched.
I can say that his acting is almost natural.
I love the song.
I just downloaded the song.
And salute to Yasmin.
We can see how Yasmin really appreciated her parents in an unique way.
The different character was portrayed with eagerness and mild humor.
Its not just about entertainment.
Not even to make out in the cinema.
Rest of the cast do fine.
And these things do not happen in the open.
TB was real too.
At that time my island was not the holiday resort it has become.
After the war there were times of hardship.
Now people strain just to think of new ideas.
For true fans of classic horror.
This is for you.
But it is a terrific movie for as old as it is.
The atmosphere here is what sets it apart.
Those really lower this one a bit.
Strong performances from a stellar cast.
Some haunting moments and images.
The low budget really shows at times.
Watch this one with the lights off.
The first segment is a great kickoff to the film.
The private teacher and nanny Mrs.
This best segment maintains a very creepy atmosphere and a genuinely scary plot.
All four segments have a delightfully macabre sense of humor and a great atmosphere.
Plot contrivance similar to PREMATURE BURIAL.
This segment also lacks the solidity of the first two.
Death and the maiden.
The unifying theme that connects each story is the house itself.
The fourth segment was the silliest and was meant to parody the genre.
Highly recommended to fans of omnibus fright fare.
You will probably be back many more times to watch your favorites.
This movie is another horror anthology.
It has four stories all somewhat connected by a house.
The first tale is about a writer and his wife moving in.
The third story starts out rather good and features Christopher Lee.
It drags a bit leading to a very predictable conclusion.
The actor really gets what he paid for.
I think they needed a bit more back story for that one.
All in all though it was an interesting set of stories.
I will not spoil it for you.
Story three stars one of my very favorites.
Well come to find out.
This episode is striking for its simplicity and stark terror.
The final images presented to us in this story are pretty shocking.
My feelings for them today are just as strong.
I spent many years trying to track down this movie.
The linking story later sees him visiting the estate agent who sold the house.
Lee gives one his perfect ice cold performances here.
He shows no love or attention for his daughter at all.
He even brings in a school governess to educate her.
So he decides to buy an authentic cloak for his latest vampire role.
It truly is hilarious.
The linking story finishes with a loose connection to the final story.
The rest you will be able to work out for yourself.
The movie focuses on a house that strangely accommodates whomever lives there.
You read that right.
A very cool movie.
Film is designed to affect the audience and this film left me speechless.
The story is sweeping.
Supporting players are excellently cast and lend a real sense of authenticity.
I absolutely love the photography.
Some spooky moments and the twist at the end was good.
A very good and unusual movie score too.
All in all a good little horror anthology well worth seeking out.
Horror omnibus films were popular in the seventies.
This story stars the legendary Christopher Lee as a seemingly overprotective father.
The beauty of this story comes from the way it is played out.
Go in expecting quality entertainment and you will not be disappointed.
George Bernard Shaw is my favorite playwright.
That is how this picture is to be enjoyed.
The innocent have always had to suffer for the ambitions of the mighty.
John Gielgud performed outstandingly.
He is the English politico who is orchestrating the show.
knowing such an action guarantees immortality.
This is one of his very best and most effective films.
Preminger does none of this.
Its hard to imagine her really carrying out anything as gruesome as an autopsy.
Diagnosis Murder is one of the only programs i watch regularly on TV now.
People are expected to suffer.
This is one of those movies.
And a great movie it is.
Mark Sloan a Doctor at Community General Hospital in L.
A who is also a Police consultant for the L.
Along for the ride is Dr.
Jack Stewart was replaced by the younger Dr.
I remember the early days.
So just for suggesting it I was awarded.
Dick had a terrific sense of modernism when he built that house.
Now it is gone TV is a worse place.
The movie takes place in a little Swedish town where everybody knows each other.
I saw this at the Mill Valley Film Festival.
Hard to believe this is Ms.
I really hope this gets distribution in the USA.
Later we meet three of these children again as adults at a sanatorium.
Here we see what life has wrought on each of them.
One is a reclusive sexually repressed patient.
Another man is a hustler who has become ill.
This film is an allegory about the effect of violence on the psyche.
The acting is excellent and the script is quite well written.
There is a musical score that provides an undercurrent of dread throughout this film.
This is an incredible film.
I can not remember the last time I saw a Swedish movie this layered.
Or at least do not realize how close they are.
The writing is also very appealing.
I can not wait for her next one.
Would appreciate any help anyone can give me on this.
Thanks very much in advance for your assistance.
I still have the tape and enjoy watching it again from time to time.
Suzy Kendall will hold your interest throughout.
Has not been shown on American TV for a decade.
One scene that has always stayed with me is the German cavalry gas attack.
You will find others.
Hope they soon put it on tape.
There must be some commercial or copyright reason why this movie is not available.
I too recall the poison gas attack and the weirdly garbed horses.
And I think I have to try to catch more movies with Suzy Kendall.
We first meet three boys that are playing happily.
Not everything is what it seems.
He seems to be suffering from tuberculosis.
Their relationship will have devastating consequences.
You will not be disappointed.
I saw this film by chance on the small box.
It has a fantastic and chilling scene about poisonous gas.
A lot about fanatical patriotism.
A bit of eroticism.
The Germans move forward slowly menacingly in their scary looking garb.
Suddenly a scream from the defenders.
This gas is like no other that they have experienced before.
I only wish I had taped the film.
This is for many reasons.
The music is probably what makes this episode work so well.
That made me cringe.
7 Out of 10.
In Spanish with English subtitles.
Nine stars should give it enough credit.
I really enjoyed this episode.
This is the thrill i got from watching this episode.
It sort of lost its touch when the show started focusing on Lana.
This episode is incredible.
I loved this episode.
Chloe is mysteriously saved from Dr.
My vote is ten.
Joining Sanders in the cast are Wendy Barrie and Jonathan Hale.
Not a bad Saint movie.
Shortly after he tries to protect her from the police.
There is also an interesting role for Gilbert Emery.
It will entertain you even if it does not remain in your memory.
These shows include Mr.
That would be great.
There should be more episodes made about Human Kimberly.
He is on some places to uncooked to be good to see.
But thats is in German films always so.
Thats difficult to understand.
Thats not clear for the other girl Nina in this film.
But Nina lost everything.
She will play with soft emotion and a sad feeling.
Thats so often the way it goes in German films.
This films tries not on every place to gave her a part inside.
But the film stand always in some distance to seem.
There is no much explaining of them.
The two girls got to a casting.
And there they should say how they find together.
In this scene Toni will lying on.
And then Nina will say the truth.
She said it in an introversion way.
There is no exhibition in it.
She looks to the bottom and said what will happened for here.
Thats a great moment.
And the humor is all done in some style of Earthworm Jim.
which i think has absolutely failed.
the scenes in the back really got to my heart.
she is one of the most impressing actress i have ever seen.
in future i will watch more of her movies.
This was a wonderful film.
How these women tried to save their husbands.
I thought that the performances of the actors were great.
I had to think about the film for a very long time.
I wish I could be so strong as a woman.
We should remember something like the war forever.
But rank and privilege merit no special consideration.
Fortunately the eight year old daughter Ruth escapes capture.
Of course the family in New York could be speaking German.
So that criticism is unwarranted.
To say more would spoil the experience.
Most disappointing is the end.
Goebbels motivation in backing down was not explored.
This is referred to in the film.
I understand the majority survived the war.
The details are given in an addendum that follows this review.
Hannah easily persuades the woman to tell her story.
It all seems rather too pat.
The story of the protest is told simply.
It is too long.
You keep waiting for some vicious attack to begin any minute.
The somberness of the film stayed with me afterward.
But they were mistaken.
The women won an astonishing victory over the forces of destruction.
That it works so well is a tribute to Ms.
It is tragic that the example did not catch on.
Those days were simply not discussed.
The roundup is shown here in all its frightening intensity.
The young Lena tries to locate her husband.
Through increasingly angry protestations the women finally prevail.
The main actors are uniformly impressive.
But that is understandable.
Unfortunately that argument is nonsense.
I wanna see the season 4 episodes badly.
I am happy about every information I can get.
I love this show.
Holly goes to live with Val when their dad is transferred to Japan.
This film is not about the obvious.
I just recently started watching the show and have fell in love.
All the characters in the show give something to the whole story line.
I really enjoy it.
But that is what made the show so great.
The show is about two sisters living together.
And the show is also about friendship.
The priorities in life.
I loved this show so much.
It is funny and the actors are so good.
I am really sad that the show is over.
Jenny Garth may be new to comedy but she plays really well.
She is one of the actresses i like watching.
Gary is a natural talent and makes you laugh each time he shows up.
With Tina Holly found a real friend and i really like them hanging out.
Lauren character is so funny and she is a natural talent.
I would like to see her more.
This show really takes you in and makes you laugh.
A family film in every sense and one that deserves the praise it received.
8 out of 10.
The film is great on many levels.
4 out of 10.
This was just another marvelous film of the Berlin Festival.
There is no Marie in this world to accompany our lonely lives.
Both characters are smart.
I assume no one took the time to rethink the script.
This is not a bad film.
It has a few funny moments.
It is quite a simple not very active but very charming film.
The casting alone makes it a nearly perfect movie.
The casting alone makes it a nearly perfect movie.
I'm glad Cher won an Oscar for that movie.
I miss these scenes.
It also beautifully involves older characters.
Cage and Cher do very nice work.
Loretta confronts Ronny and quickly falls in love with him.
I really liked it the second time.
I loved it the third time.
Now it is one of my all time favorites.
The humor is subtle but really good.
The film offers a lot of warmth humor.
the story takes place in a old school Italian neighborhood in NYC.
The old man character is fantastic.
He lights up the screen without saying a word.
The scene with his dogs howling at the moon was fantastic.
Exceptional direction and wrap up.
Creative story line with a very talented cast.
Is infidelity by men a way of avoiding thoughts of death.
There are lovely little moments in the film too.
Her hearing the argument in the liquor shop and it is resolution.
It is the sweetest moment of the entire film.
It is close to a flawless film.
Yet nothing seems done with this potential rivalry.
This film stands head and shoulders above the vast majority of cinematic romantic comedies.
This movie is still an all time favorite.
She is one of the most unique artists out there.
I never get tired of watching this movie.
She was more conventional than her own mom.
She would probably end up making an awesome mom too.
There is nothing not to like about Moonstruck.
they were all fantastic.
New York has never looked so good on the screen.
Of course they fall instantly for each other.
She won and really deserved the Oscar that year.
This movie is brilliant in every way.
This silly movie is really fun for the younger audiences.
everything adolescents go for.
Definite cult classic potential.
Disney had some cartoons with caricatures of black entertainers as well.
50 years from now.
and even vilified by future viewers.
Bing Crosby reportedly hated it when he was used on more than one occasion.
This is bar none the most hilarious movie I have ever seen.
I own 2 copies of this movie on video.
Some really Funny Funny stuff.
The Actors and Music rocked.
The humor in the film itself is pure MAD magazine.
I do not see why MAD stand behind this feature.
I own the soundtrack and I play it constantly to this day.
This movie has it all.
I put in the top 15 funniest movies.
Great soundtrack keeps the film moving.
I remember NOT seeing the Alfred E.
Surely there are many worse movies to be associated with.
It does get better with every viewing.
I agree with all of the positive reviews here.
I found myself doing commentary as I watched it.
Someone on here said Rip Torn was miscast.
Also a star is the stark Montana prairie.
It is both beautiful and brutal country in which to settle.
There are some scenes that are both repulsive and necessary.
Reality is slaughtering pigs and other livestock in order to survive.
It was also nice to see the west inhabited by real people.
I saw this 25 years ago on PBS.
It was very difficult to watch.
To watch this small family struggle in the winter was heart rending.
Both were widowed and together they worked to build a new home.
That only makes the tragedy extra sad.
I was crying so hard.
But then they went out and successfully pulled out a new calf.
Torn and Ms Farrel do an outstanding job.
Great unheard of movie.
It was done when Ms.
Farrel was very young.
Torn as always is a great presence and just his breathing has great feeling.
I must see movie.
None of them came as close to telling the story as this movie does.
This western is done in a different manner than most others.
Realism is the key here.
How this is presented makes for a most interesting slice of Americana.
Outstanding acting by both principal actors.
you feel like you are there.
Animal activists should beware.
many scenes are obviously not just realistic.
This is one of the best films ever made.
The film keeps your interest without the added Hollywood myths.
This film is worth your time to see.
It improves with age.
No one declaims any Hollywood movie speeches.
The actors really inhabit their roles.
The film is based on the lives of real people.
She advertises for a position as housekeeper.
The three characters go for long periods without seeing another human soul.
Their son is still an infant when he gets sick and dies.
They lose half their livestock to the vicious winter.
Clyde calls Elinore urgently to help him deliver the calf.
He and Elinore must physically pull the calf out of the birth canal.
This little gem rewards patience and thoughtfulness.
Probably enough to hurt your stomach.
Take the time and check this out.
Well worth a two hour viewing.
I watched the presentation of this on PBS in the U.
Today I found this web site.
I will give up the search.
I would however disagree with the above comment.
This whole storyline is cloth.
The changes in Set similarly damage the integrity of the story.
Spoken in Spanish with English subtitles.
The film features sumptuous costuming and sets and a good cast and acting.
A good film for those interested in renaissance painting or period films.
Though not really an art house film.
It does provide a little emotionally charged scenes from time to time.
I have two complaints.
The voice you hear whispering from time to time is not explained.
That led to a conclusion that differs from the record.
Seldom have I seen a movie that so compelled my eyes.
So I set out exploring her life and work afterwards.
Overall i thought this film was fantastic.
Highly recommended to those who has not seen one in a while.
The camera work is principally indoors for that is where the artists mainly worked.
There are some great shots.
Her father is outraged.
This romantic drama has a fairly simple story with an unsatisfactory ending.
The outstanding feature of the film is its artistic presentation and attention to detail.
The story is like a sad love story with an unhappy ending.
that this film was never made to be historically accurate.
She is a gorgeous creature who awakened passion in men.
The music by Krishna Levy serves well what we see.
It had one or more famous celebrities in the middle of it.
It was number 52 on The 100 Greatest Funny Moments.
George Hilton portrays Peter Lynch.
a dangerous turn of events.
It has both the English and Italian language options which is a real bonus.
This applies to both the movie and the documentary in the extras.
The film works on many different levels.
Sexy Anita Strindberg is absolutely ravishing in the female lead.
Gable and Crawford made a great team.
The less you know about the story the better to make it work.
He was a brave man.
The plot has a very clever twist that has be seen to be enjoyed.
This is a movie with heart and excellent acting by all.
Make some popcorn and have a great evening.
This movie is just plain silly.
This movie is funny and suitable for any age.
Anderson playing the very young Halloween carnivorous duck has just great lines.
But subtle and enjoyable it is.
The movie kept me laughing despite having seen a few times.
The special effects are surprisingly good for this film.
I had to write this review.
Do not dismiss this film as trash.
This is cult stuff.
My friends and I get together once a year to enjoy this movie.
Its very funny and very dry .
A great play on War of the Worlds.
She had never attempted a role like that before and critics were impressed.
This film starts out with a spectacular house boat party.
Rodney also surprises her with the news that he also has a job.
This is a super film with Crawford and Gable giving it their all.
i loved this movie.
you have to respect midgets that dressed up like tiny Martians.
i used to watch this over and over again when i was 8.
If you have trouble dreaming you may give this movie a low rating.
The point is to suspend reality and just have FUN.
And this movie has Fun aplenty.
Wish I had one when I was growing up.
I do not know how anyone could hate this movie.
It is so funny.
It took a unique mind to come up with this storyline.
These aliens are so stupid and confused.
You need to rent it at least once.
This movie is not for everyone.
I recommend this movie for those who can appreciate spoofs and parodies.
Everyone I have recommended this film to has enjoyed it.
The audience laughed its heads off.
Ariana Richards and J.
Anderson are great as the lead kids.
Take a look at the Martian costumes next time.
Fun for the whole family.
Great to see him playing something different.
Each episode was a new short story.
I would suggest watching the series if it is available.
So it has to get draggy.
Even the nasal singing sensations songs could not make up.
But personally I feel this is a pathetic copy.
Rest star cast was simply okay.
The ending of the movie is very different from most movies.
It is not clear if she has similar feelings for him or not.
Watch the movie for complete details.
I look forward to seeing more movies from him.
A must see I will rate it 8.
The way Delhi is shown is very good and gives a fresh feeling.
Other actors did their job well.
5 stars out of 5.
Griffith achieves the claustrophobic effect here in two ways.
First is his use of space.
The Sealed Room contains a good example of what I mean.
This early Biograph short was so much fun to watch.
The second on disc one of D.
The best moment comes at the end.
Johnson as the Count.
I give this movie a well deserved ten.
Not even Sir Alec.
The Wooden Horse is one of the quietest films I have ever watched.
It is utterly of its time and works beautifully.
They keep emotion out of their roles.
This unemotional approach does not detract from any dramatic tension.
I saw this movie on Comedy Central a few times.
This movie was pretty good.
can get an army base there to balance power in the Middle East.
It gave me great political spirit.
Ten out of ten was my rating for this movie.
It is truly a slice of life.
Photographic stills resemble Rembrandt prints.
Sometimes subtle dialog and hidden literate touches found throughout.
I just saw this movie for the first time ever and I liked it.
Her dancing was very entertaining.
The scenery was great too.
Yvonne is such a talented woman and beautiful.
I am slowly purchasing all her movies and watching them as I receive them.
I have a large collection of her memorabilia.
She did escape to the American west.
To hate this movie is to hate freedom itself.
His triumph is an inspiration to all.
I love old Burt Reynolds movies.
They are funnier and better than every other movie combined.
This is a hilarious film.
You can see many race cars from 1983.
This is sort of a Mr.
It made me laugh and made me mad at the same time.
And the speech she made at the end.
Too bad not many people have guts like that in real life.
This is a dramatic film in the whole sense of the word.
Sure it has some extremes.
but every now and then real life sorrow surpasses art.
But after watching this I felt astonished.
The movies is great without a big try.
The problem is that he is not one of these people.
It is disarmingly friendly and lively.
It refreshes the mind.
This serial is unjustly bashed.
This movie was one of the best movies that I have seen this year.
It actually has a point.
From the very beginning I was so excited to see this movie.
The poster is possibly the funniest I have ever seen for a movie.
I immediately bought one for my dorm this September.
Every element came together in this movie so beautifully.
This is what makes a movie easy to remember fondly.
And they are funny.
She charms the national press with her zany remarks and her sweet looks.
She even grabs the romantic attention of a State department official.
Sunny learns her way around the jungle of the U.
I was very pleasantly surprised with this film.
One of the biggest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year.
To put him out of his misery and get him laid.
This is a sex comedy and it wants to be bad.
For the most part I think it succeeded.
This man has talent it The 40 Year Old Virgin proves that.
The comedic parts were great to see from actors not very big or popular.
As you can see people do like this movie it is currently rated 7.
i think it should be in 250.
see it if you want a laugh.
This movie is a riot.
But this one is wall to wall great lines.
Other than that it is a constant barrage of one liners and goofy situations.
You have to see it two or three times to get it all in.
All the characters are great.
No victims in this movie.
Catherine Keener plays her and she is a sweetheart in this film.
You just wish that women like her really existed.
They do not give away all the good jokes.
Just some of the mediocre ones.
Oh and one more thing.
I hope critics put this on their top ten list.
We care about him.
His neurotic traits combine the best of Woody Allen with childish naivety.
His friends are not unlikable jerks and his romance is tumultuous and bittersweet.
It strikes a chord with the audience.
I was really surprised with this movie.
I dare you to see this film and to not laugh.
The plot is simple.
A man is forty years old and he is a virgin.
Watch one of the brightest ones of the summer right now.
My mom would have walked out during the first scene.
I'm not a big fan of excessive profanity and sex jokes.
But that is me.
Be that your guide.
this is one of the funnier films i have seen.
but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first.
Both have some sort of formula to the stories as well.
This is one of the funniest films of the year.
What a great surprise.
I laughed so hard I cried at some of the jokes.
My girlfriend and I both loved it.
Everyone pulls their weight and the chemistry is perfect.
I would highly recommend.
I had tears in my eyes from laughter throughout a lot of the movie.
He proves in this movie his tremendous talent for comedy.
And Catherine Keener is excellent as always.
There were parts of comedic genius in this movie.
Just came out of a sneak preview for this film.
It had me laughing every 30 secs.
Paul Rudd is hilarious as always.
Leslie Mann also had some incredibly funny moments.
I highly recommend it for those who just want to laugh like a maniac.
It would make for some incredibly awkward moments.
This movie was okay.
These two should have had a lot more time on screen together.
They are chemistry was great.
A class act but underrated and forgotten.
This is a crying shame.
Most notable were the unforgettable titles.
A fond memory from my childhood.
I often wonder why this series was slammed so much.
I thought it was brilliant and also very cleverly written and performed.
If it is ever issued I will certainly buy it.
In a final note it is obvious that this production was no small feat.
This is the art of film at its best.
Astounding color and fast energy.
I hope they make a sequel.
That would be fun.
My only problem with it is the performance of Melissa Connor as Anya.
I do not what the director was thinking when he cast her.
Sure it skims over political issues.
I tend to differ on this point.
She has always made me laugh cheerfully and innocently.
She has never tried to be anything else but who she is.
If it even comes that late.
I was shocked by the fight sequences they were great.
This was true brilliance.
I think you will be pleasantly surprised.
here comes the Romeo Division to change the paradigm.
Let me just say that I was BLOWN AWAY by this short film.
I have watched this movie three times.
Perhaps the plot is not intended to hang together logically.
I must have missed something significant here.
She always had a falling out with her men and she rejected them.
This pattern held with Harris and two husbands.
None of this communication appeared on the film.
I kept wondering about the house Ann was living in during her final days.
The seaside mansion was just so heartbreakingly beautiful.
Claire Danes was luminous as the young Ann Grant.
She is really quite a talented singer.
Judge this film on your own.
Evening is an entertaining movie with quite some depth.
All the actors and actresses turn in spectacular performances.
One can relate to personalities and situations in ones own family.
This is one of the few movies that inspires one to read the book.
I will definitely obtain a copy of the Susan Minot book and read it.
Any car buff will enjoy the apparently expertly restored period automobiles.
See it you will enjoy it.
Ann Grant Lord is dying.
Her two daughters arrive to be at her bedside.
Her performance is not easily forgettable.
She is very good.
His performance is superior.
I can not recommend Evening too much.
Here are some remarks.
Vanessa Redgrave is great even while lying in bed.
I think her aging got a bit harsh in recent years.
Claire Danes continues her welcome return to the movies and exudes a definite warmth.
Their interplay is weak.
Toni Collette additionally is way too old for her character.
The cinematography is excellent as expected.
However the main summer house set failed to convince me.
A bit too cardboard like.
It is a vehicle to show that there are no mistakes in life.
The story itself is nicely told and very obviously adapted from literature.
It is the acting that makes the flashbacks so enthralling and fluid.
Patrick Wilson is always great in whatever I have seen him in.
My vote is seven.
Everything was just so perfect and excellent about this film.
I loved the message that there are no mistakes.
I saw this movie Sunday afternoon.
I absolutely loved this movie.
I loved these moments because they were just so real.
But during the middle of the movie i felt completely different.
Individual tunes are woven into a symphony.
Evening is the beautiful story of the flawed love of a mother.
The cast is glowing in Evening.
There is a great deal of infighting between Nina and her sister Constance.
Their fights remind me of ones I have with my sister all the time.
Her character is stuck between her heart and her status in society.
I can not wait to see her act in something else in the future.
I was constantly amazed.
Patrick Wilson is mesmerizing as Harris.
Glen Close has my favorite scene in the movie.
It is terrible and jaw dropping grief.
I was utterly stunned.
The one acting disappointment was Natasha Richardson.
The visuals of the movie are sparkling.
The visual concepts of the flash back sequences are powerful and resonating.
Evening is a powerful movie.
Evening is defiantly a chick flick but a really great chick flick.
I caught Evening in the cinema with a lady friend.
I feel disloyal to Ms.
I think that Ms.
We would not have The Hours if Virginia Woolf had not written Mrs.
But it is too much to say that it would be better if Ms.
I'm 14 years old and I love this cartoon.
This movie is really funny and I love the songs.
Other characters like King Gator I found really funny.
He is then given a crash course in the horrible realities of war.
Same goes for the endearing relationship between Alfred and Bernie.
The characters are just that engaging enough to carry the whole show.
A truly moving little story that deserves more credit than it is being given.
He is also outside of traditional gender relations.
I had a crush on a cartoon dog.
I saw this film when it was originally released in 1989.
A film worth experiencing.
You could tell Charlie was all gruff and stuff and the backgrounds were beautiful.
Gambling is a key element in the movie.
The good guy dies.
It was set in New Orleans in 1939.
Charlie tries to make up for it by buying her dresses.
Charlie loses everything and all he has left is this little girl.
In the end he had to choose between her life and his own.
very touching and I gotta go.
It just sounds weird.
Dogs Are So Cute As Little Mice.
All Dogs Go To Heaven Is The Best Animated Movie Ever.
This OVA is kinda the opposite.
This movie did a fantastic job of that.
I love All Dogs Go to Heaven even though I'm a guy.
This is one of the greatest movies ever maybe even the greatest movie ever.
I had forgotten about the movie for about 12 years.
Which I Believe makes the movie from good to great.
This is definitely a must see for people of all ages.
I saw it in 1989 when I was two years old.
I love the songs in this movie.
Those are beautiful songs.
The only thing that bothers me about the movie is Charlie dieing.
Other than that this movie is wonderful.
They are so cute.
Overall I love this movie and suggest everyone should see it.
That depends on the kid.
At the time most animated movies were a little too childish for my tastes.
All Dogs Go to Heaven plays on the canine criminal underworld.
This is a cute animation loved very much through my eyes as a child.
I would highly recommend this film to children.
I'm unsure about how adults would react to it.
I still love this movie even at the age of 22.
In that picture he appeared quite dubious to his role of villain.
Itchy is his sidekick.
It is set during the prohibition in the United States.
The backgrounds are good too.
I would rate it more of a drama than action.
Sometimes you have to lose to win.
The movie is filled with fun songs and music.
The animation is brilliant and the character voices are perfect.
Recommended for the whole family.
I'm 22 years old and the ending still gets to me.
Not to mention that it is just so cute and touching.
All Dogs Go To Heaven is a movie that I have always liked.
This is good and your kids will probably like it.
The movie itself is fun and smart.
It gets 10 simply because it made me feel.
I loved this film when I was little.
Today at 17 it is one of my all time favorite animated films.
but eventually will win you over.
Not a kiddie film by any means.
Often very dark and frightening at times.
But do keep a tissue in handy.
I first saw it when I was like 3.
If only I could go back to those days.
I love the characters.
What a fun movie St.
Richard Grant provides comic relief of the highest order.
He spends his days daydreaming about Mobile Suits and playing war with his friends.
The acting is splendid.
Miranda Richardson and Richard E.
The fundamental difference is the Story and the Director.
His stunt scenes are clearly outstanding.
This is movie is very touching.
The direction is very good.
What a outstanding movie is this i have not words to describe.
i do not know how come the rating of the movie is 7.
3 it should be 9.
but i know the people has deferent chooses so ya.
But it is one for the masses.
Simply great movie no doubt about it.
But the message and concept this movie carries are absolutely superb.
The story is simplistic while the uncomplicated screenplay has a very elementary approach.
An excellent movie about two cops loving the same woman.
Young Peggy arrives in Hollywood seeking stardom.
Great screenplay and some of the best actors the world has ever produced.
But his superior knows that he usually works alone.
Its much more personal and people can relate to it.
Her sombre clothes and empty and cold house convey her inside emotions very well.
Lets see where her character venture to.
The chick can act.
Most of the characters are hell bent on cutting metaphorical chunks off themselves.
So no chance of a baby there then.
No you do not.
Jessica is an experimental lesbian.
I thought script writers were supposed to earn their living.
I trust they learn one lesson though.
So I score 7.
This if played right could be the next Cold feet.
Plus the male cast are not bad on the eyes too.
This shows us a reality of life.
The movie concept is more that interesting.
connecting the storytelling with real life events.
keeping us aware of everything.
Some of the movie was shot aboard the U.
Fisher is an obviously bright enlisted man assigned to the U.
Sent to the M.
Nor is it truly a film about blacks.
It deserves wide distribution.
Derek Luke may well get an Oscar nomination.
Good old Hollywood style entertainment family values entertainment with just a hint of corn.
My introduction to Ms.
My introduction to Mr.
This is my favorite movie EVER.
I have watched it at least 10 times and I cry every time.
But this is my favorite movie he has done so far.
I took care of a little boy who was also born in jail.
He was the most precious little boy I had ever met.
This young actor has a very bright future.
See it opening weekend.
You will not be disappointed.
But I'm a sucker for those so I gave it a good score.
the acting was very good and there were a lot of feeling.
The violence is kept to a minimal which makes a change.
That is what makes good cinema.
I can say that it is the best film I have seen all year.
This movie was incredible.
If the academy overlooks this film it will be travesty.
The acting job by Derek Luke was outstanding and the story line was excellent.
Only superficial viewing can condemn this film as superficial.
What makes this film good is the fact that it is not overly melodramatic.
Get ready to shed a tear or two.
The movie could thaw the coldest heart.
There were many scenes which I enjoyed watching.
All the actors represented their parts well.
He had a strong presence in this movie.
The chemistry flowed well between the romantic characters.
Novella Nelson who played the part of Mrs.
What an awesome movie and incredible young man.
I defy anyone not to shed a tear by the end of the movie.
Whats more is that this is a true story.
There is not much more to say about this movie it is excellent.
There are some wonderful things about this movie.
I guess it is really hard to be discriminated.
It is very good.
I cried for almost a day after I saw this the first time.
BUT another set of parents picked me up and loved me.
And it helped me to realize just how messed up our social system is.
The film has a very professional look.
It shows that Mr.
Washington has learned a lot being on the other side of the camera.
He brings a different angle to this film.
The abuse he suffers at the hands of Mrs.
The lead performances are very good indeed.
Davenport has his own problems too.
He is not a happy camper either.
The talent in the film is incredible.
Joy Bryant makes a fine Cheryl.
My vote is eight.
There are so many out there.
A stunning film of high quality.
He is on the brink of being a loser.
Outstanding performances from the whole cast.
The story is in effect a family tragedy with emotional and physical torment.
All the actors give full blooded performances with conviction and realism.
One message from the movie is the importance of raising children decently.
10 out of 10.
Talk about deserving an Oscar.
Written and directed by Steve Gordon.
It was the quintessential comedy of the decade.
It won Sir John Gielgud the Academy Award.
It also looks at its characters with sincere empathy.
But I saw it for like the second time about 7 years ago.
My sister told me I had to see it.
Now my whole family has it memorized.
We quote it at least once a day.
I still laugh after all this time.
And that he is willing to give it all up for love.
A lot of laughs.
It will make you laugh for years to come.
A treasure of a film.
This film is very witty film that relies hugely on the actors talent.
Worth seeing many times.
but with a modern touch.
He is also wistful and real.
some of us drink because we are not poets.
The score is also extremely memorable and compliments the film perfectly.
The only real problem with the film is the ill fated sequel it spawned.
This comedy is a good lesson for life for anyone.
Rich people are not usually happy with their ways of life.
This is one of my favorite comedies ever.
The ladies of the piece are also well portrayed.
This has been one of my favorite movies for a long time.
Arthur does what he feels like and says whatever comes into his mind.
He spends money on people he do not know and finds everything funny.
This is a damn funny film.
Its very corny at times.
There are so many fantastic one liners in the film.
Its not a laugh riot but it has some fantastic moments.
He is very good with words and body language.
John Gielgud got an Oscar for this film.
I do not know that actor.
Movie has some flat patches but not very long ones.
looking forward to watch the sequel.
That is not the way I wish to be remembered.
We have most lines memorized.
This movie makes me just enjoy watching movies.
Show People is a perfect introduction to silent films.
Some of the lines in this movie are just unbeatable.
It went down just like I would imagined it would be like.
They were all laughing so hard it was difficult for them to film it.
The late Sir John Gielgud was a wonderful addition to this.
There should be a dozen movies like this in our archive.
This is a truly splendid movie.
He invariably steals any scene in which he features and thoroughly deserved his Oscar.
Hollywood seemed to loose interest in cuddly Dudley after these two outings.
We can only imagine the other great movies he should have made.
Arthur is a truly enchanting romantic comedy for for everyone.
Sir John Gielgud was the heart of the film and deserved his Oscar.
John Gielgud gets all the juicy lines and polishes them off with relish.
Arthur has always been a personal film for me for two reasons.
Frank was a champion equestrian and will be missed by all who knew him.
The wonder with Arthur is why anyone would bother with him wealth of not.
But that is the other half of the equation.
My friend was a most charming person when you got to know him.
In fact it was almost a compulsion to be charming.
He spent his life being a perfect party guest.
Unlike my friend Moore has John Gielgud to clean up after him.
We should all have such troubles.
Yet 1981 was a year of sentiment at Oscar time.
4 out of 10 possible.
I found so many similarities between Dudley Moore and Keith Moon in this movie.
We often try to catch a rerun of this movie on satellite.
The close friendship between Moore and Sir John is rather endearing.
Arthur is an interesting fellow.
She had excellent comic instincts and timing.
He gets Peggy an acting job.
Over time they become romantically involved.
A good film all round.
It really is a great song about New York City as well.
Jill would later star on LA Law.
She plays a diner waitress.
One of the true romantic comedy classics from the 20th century.
This one also gets a solid ten on the voting scale.
He also refuses to leave the bottle.
There are hilarious set pieces aplenty.
You could feel how raw the emotions were during those incredibly hard episodes.
This show is beautifully done.
That is what I think.
I love having C.
and Grandpa living at the house because they are so funny together.
It is too bad that no more are being made.
My favorite character must be Rory.
poor Rory is almost always left out.
It is always about Bridget or Carrie.
I almost guarantee you will laugh.
This family is so real and funny.
But generally a very funny show with lots of laughs and fun.
I was gutted to find out that he had died when i browsed Google.
Eight Simple rules started as a very entertaining series.
J is unnecessary to the show.
This show is awesome.
I loved it when Kerry made sarcastic remarks about everything.
I always laughed at that.
This was a marvelously funny comedy with a great cast.
James Garner was a good addition.
It could have lasted longer had Ritter lived.
I especially loved it when they brought in Ed O'Neill in a guest spot.
The show changed somewhat after Mr.
My personal favorite episode is in the last season.
I recommend this to any fan of those who made it.
That in itself makes Show People a film worth saving.
How Rory punches a wall in anger and frustration.
How Cate deals with having to sleep in her bed all alone.
who is absolutely hilarious as the wild cousin.
Katey and the three kids are really a solid professional cast.
This show has matured and developed because of such impossible circumstances.
You will enjoy it.
8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter had an auspicious start.
Each one was a standout.
We viewers gave him the respect and love he never had.
Cate is the conservative mom and loving wife.
Those characters were the main ones at the time of John Ritter.
This was the first time that I saw him do anything.
His performance was very impressive.
I still shiver just remembering it.
Suffice it to say that it is something you will NEVER forget.
it should never have ended but still love watching the repeats everyday.
More so than any show that old.
I think it was televised on Sat.
That is the one show that I wish I could see again.
I recently had the pleasure of seeing The Big Bad Swim at the Ft.
But this masterful film proved me wrong.
You will probably even laugh more than you would at most talkie comedies.
I hope it will be released soon so everyone can see it.
This is a terrific work deserving of a larger audience.
The plot is fairly thin.
The two actresses give natural performances and work well together.
The latter keeps the narrative moving at a fast clip.
What surprised me about the film was how real it felt.
Rarely in ensemble pieces are characters treated so well.
See it if you get the opportunity.
Writing something genuine and true is challenging.
but giving something to see is better.
I was never bored.
I never stepped out of the story on the screen.
I'm sure this will have wide appeal and should be given a chance.
What a shame so much has been lost.
I was really impressed with this film.
I consider myself a huge movie buff.
I was sick on the couch and popped in this film.
The filming was beautiful.
It was just what I needed.
I hope that this message is heard over any bad comments written by others.
The Director has a heart and it beats with his actors throughout.
There is nothing typically independent about this film.
This is one of those films.
I felt like my adrenaline had kicked in.
She makes you feel like you know her personally as a friend.
I can not say enough nice things about The Big Bad Swim.
I look forward to future projects from all of those involved in its production.
The students characters are mainstream U.
This final Voyager episode begins 23 years in the future.
Voyager has made it back home.
He carried a disease they were too late getting home to cure.
The Conduit is deep inside Borg Space.
This is a great ending to the show.
The fact that Adm.
was a great way to show a new beginning.
Voyager could have continued.
Harry was annoying at times but a okay character at other times.
Plenty of cameos for film buffs.
Then she goes to her friend and starts selling drugs.
She is much better suited to drama than to comedy.
The script is well done as is the cinematography and direction.
Yet it was done so well.
I applaud the director for making this movie.
I thought this movie did a down right good job.
Just the kind of movie I love.
Some very good British actors as well as the one and only Sharon Stone.
Sharon Stone is also an easy target.
And a fun film it is.
Glass is drawn into a seductive game that Trammel uses to manipulate his mind.
Attempts at censorship were vehemently denied.
It also received widespread critical acclaim.
If not always in the right way.
Check out the memorable quotes section for a chuckle.
Davies was adorable and a lively comedienne.
This movie was doomed before it even opened.
Still it is not too bad.
It feels like a retread of the first.
just like people were being killed by an ice pick in the first.
The similarities are too apparent.
The acting is good across the board.
Still I recommend it.
Just came back from the first showing of Basic Instinct 2.
Great story that always keeps you wondering and thinking.
Am thinking about going to see it again this weekend.
The original Basic Instinct takes place in San Francisco.
We start all of our reviews with the following information.
The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO.
Well enough about that.
This movie is very good.
not just good but very good.
The critics are a bunch of morons.
Just because there is nudity and language they hated it.
I can not accept the negative comments of other reviewers.
It still left me wondering at the end but in a more satisfactory way.
I found this movie to be very good in all areas.
a must seen over and over again until the delight fades away.
thank you for reading.
I think there are quite good improvements in the basic plot.
She is not only gorgeous but hilarious in this film.
I never would have thought it to end up such as this.
This is a good thing.
Her second run of the deceitful novelist is right on the spot as earlier.
5 to 9 out of 10.
I have no idea what people are complaining about.
I saw this movie yesterday and I really liked it.
Stone once again delivered a great character.
She was just as good as she was in the first Basic Instinct.
She still has those smart but tricky answers.
Although Sharon may be 48 years old.
She looks good and that is that.
Basic Instinct 2 gives you everything you want from the first.
So do not listen to them.
I do not understand your objections to this movie.
I never trust the opinions of anyone regarding a film.
That goes for critics as well.
Catherine is hers and she plays her to perfection.
I was captivated by her.
Fans of the first movie want to see more of that frosty ice queen.
The score is amazing as well.
I raise my hat to Carol Reed.
And he had to deal with Orson Welles and Oliver Reed .
I suppose quality will out.
Encouraging people to type too much is not to be encouraged.
I really love this movie.
A rod and staff are there to comfort him.
In the middle is Oliver.
The best is Nancy.
Things are not as they seem.
And that kid Jack Wild was a perfect Artful Dodger.
I hated the Oliver Twist kid tho.
He was just too whiny and wimpy for my taste.
The supporting actors were great too.
Bumble role extremely well.
And he has a wonderful singing voice.
And the continuity kept you moving right along with the characters.
And this one is indeed a rare find.
Our combined rating for this was 8.
Movies do not get much better than this.
Please do not miss this one.
even if you normally do not like musicals.
It really is a rare treat.
The musical numbers are all memorable.
All of the main roles were beautifully cast.
As a child I always hated being forced to sit through musicals.
I always thought Dickens would translate well in those regards.
I saw this recently on a cable channel.
even the shabby ones.
The two young lads who play Oliver and The Artful Dodger are wonderfully talented.
The dancing is cleverly choreographed and is mesmerizing.
A film for the entire family.
A Victorian Bull Terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit.
In other versions you hate him from start to finish.
Oliver Reed was masterful.
His wife directed this masterpiece.
The music fits the times and the mood.
The subtle things in this film are the ones that make me laugh.
I love the moment Mr.
Bumble start coming out at the beginning from the governors office.
The underscore for that moment is brilliant.
They should have just done regular choreography for these scenes.
Fagin and the Dodger are the real stars of this movie.
The story is about having success in life and the way it changes you.
The great cinematic musicals were made between 1950 and 1970.
He makes the long journey to London where he hopes to seek his fortune.
if you decide to see this film.
He could not understand this.
He left thinking about what she said.
Oliver Twist was published in several editions.
Dickens tried to improve on Fagin a bit.
Then he got an idea.
He also added some additional details.
He let his female friend know about his resolve to change Fagin.
She looked at him as though he was crazy.
then I was right about that.
Instead the lady looked confused.
The landlord figures that Mr.
He is a very good man.
If Fagin saw Mr.
OLIVER won it in 1968.
She then goes on a road trip with three male companions and kills again.
He could be serious and hilarious in the same sentence.
And it is the comedy that is so often missing from his interpretations.
And then there is crime.
All of the most memorable elements are included.
Mark Lester mimes his wonderfully.
I could go on.
Soak it up with your Christmas dinner.
It all just seems perfect.
The transition from musical to movie musical is not an easy one.
All signs point to yes for this play.
I have seen hundreds of silent movies.
There are also small stories going on with the teachers of the school.
Oliver Reed and Ron Moody were brilliant.
I can not imagine anyone else playing Bill Sykes or Fagin.
His charming musical then became a hit in New York and throughout the world.
The sets and musical numbers are mind boggling.
I found that movie to be quite misogynistic.
But they just slap Sheryl Lee around way too much.
Catch it on cable if you can.
It is generally enjoyable and ranks among the better entries to the genre.
It simply could have used a bit more excitement.
SPOILER WARNING The ending was way too predictable.
There are different elements which make it a fresh movie with a similar theme.
If you like vampire movies I would recommend this one.
If you prefer your films less bloody then choose something else.
Almost too well done.
And even the optical effects supporting her kind of movement are very well made.
It really takes some beating.
He can act well and that is come to be expected of him.
I generally would not watch a horror movie.
It reaches a happy medium with the effects and story balancing each other.
There were some bad things about this movie.
i liked how it was old Mexico and not new Mexico.
with the clay houses and the old fashion churches.
I was quite surprised at how this played out.
Updated from a previous comment.
A great lampoon on Hollywood and its pretensions.
Polly Moran is a maid.
Davies and Swanson were friends.
Odd that MGM never teamed them up in a talkie.
Greta Garbo and Bebe Daniels are mentioned but do not appear.
I thought this movie was pretty good.
Jack Haley is also really good as Mike O'Brien.
Great music and some funny bits.
Yet it yielded one of their bigger hits It Never Entered My Mind.
Only Michele starts looking at another.
Not a bad bunch at all.
Bing Crosby recorded songs from his film Dixie in the same manner for Decca.
The strike provided some anxious moments for Sinatra.
He had just left the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra when the strike was called.
Fortunately Higher and Higher was received well a legend was launched.
But he outdoes himself here as Arthur.
And I love it.
And I love him.
Then my sister discovered that we had the book so I read it.
I rented the video on the same day I finished the book.
I thought it was very memorable as was the book.
The cast was brilliant.
Tara Fitzgerald was excellent as Helen and Rupert Graves was hateful as Arthur.
This is why the video is rated 15.
There are some other things that have been thrown in.
I just love watching women like these on screen.
All the actors do marvelous jobs bringing their characters to life.
So re the story as in the film I'm equivocal.
I loved this mini series.
I'm sure Anne herself would have been happy with the way it was produced.
Excellent acting and great locations.
This film successfully portrays the frustratingly restrictive lifestyle of all women of the time.
I am extremely grateful for the people responsible for making this film.
As a horse lover one can only appreciate this movie.
There are few movies that show horsemanship as this one does.
I would love to know if Brian does his own riding in the film.
Would also like to know if he enjoys horses.
Brian has been in a lot of movies where he has ridden.
You can find that in this film.
George Burns deserved that Oscar.
He gave a strong comic performance.
He was also 78 when this movie was filmed.
Jessica Tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress.
Richard Benjamin was also fantastic in this.
He won a Golden Globe for best supporting actor.
He deserved that Golden Globe.
This Comedy is an instant classic.
I highly recommend it.
The best thing about this film is the acting.
I can see why this character is such an icon.
Altogether a very pleasing sequel.
Worthwhile if you are already a fan.
Our days are limited.
Excellent movie for all women.
makers of human body.
It is amazing how we function.
The subject matter skips around an awful lot.
Our bodies are machines of a complexity that is simply inconceivable.
This film exceeded my expectations.
After a while she definitely grew on me and became a likable character.
I would recommend this film to everyone.
You are going to live for 80 years anyway.
Creep is an absolutely fantastic film with amazing film effects.
There is much mystique in this film.
My rate is 7.
And it does just that.
The ominous setting of the abandoned London subway during night is effectively used.
The score by a Bristol band called The Insects was top notch.
I really do hope he gets to make better films in the future.
It was a fun ride.
An excellent example of a simple idea developed into a compelling 90 minute script.
If this sounds like your kind of film then it probably is.
Buy a ticket and climb aboard.
now more than ever.
corporations while the government profits and American suffer.
It is very disturbing and realistic.
Some scenes between Emory and his father are moving.
However where in the U.
Something that few care to face until personally affected.
This movie struck home for me.
See if you can recognize John Goodman before he put on weight.
The aerial assault sequence is perhaps the best part of the movie.
See how many times you can spot the camera crew too.
This list is totally accurate and I can only concur with it.
It took Pulp Fiction to wake him from the slumber he had been in.
What I think is amazing is the budget this movie had.
The scenes and actors and explosions etc.
out on the deck.
That is if you like horror movies.
His demise is relatively easy to assume once the movie gets going.
Sometimes you just have to set the thinking cap down and smile.
All the criticisms registered here have valid points.
So much for warnings.
This is a masterpiece of comic acting.
About the 1976 Oscars.
This movie is not your typical horror movie.
It has some campy humor and death scenes which can be sort of comical.
I liked the performance of the hillbilly guy and of Lester.
This unpretentious Horror film is probably destined to become a cult classic.
I hope that the director will make another one.
The story lines was excellent too.
Fearful Symmetry is a pleasant episode with a few faults.
Just like he must have cared more for animals at one point.
And it is very much an episode of wonderful moments.
if you have any head for cars WATCH THIS and be blown away.
Boy are you wrong.
I have been a fan of George Burns since I was ten.
This one was also very awesome.
George Burns did a great job.
That special they were filming would have been awesome if it was really done.
I was about thirteen when this movie came out on television.
It is far superior in action than most movies since.
Vic Morrow as the villain is superb.
I'm disappointed in the low vote this received.
Possibly the coolest hot rodder in the world.
In possibly the ultimate hot rod.
He gets picked up for speeding by the Sheriff on purpose.
He checks out the lay of the land.
He knows how his brother died.
He goes out to the Curve and practices.
Another Channel 4 great canned long before it is time.
Compelling acting from Phil Davis and the rest of the cast.
But trying to find someone now who can recall it is even harder.
I suspect the latter.
Their emotions has captivated the audience.
This timeless proverb reverberates in this movie and in my heart.
It is possible that my sensibilities would not have appreciated its power.
So I now gratefully welcome it into my soul with gladness.
His is now a legendary luminescence.
She amply deserved her Oscar.
This movie is in an epic in the most classical proportions.
THE GOOD EARTH enriches one in ways that one does not expect.
But all will not come from it with the joy that I did.
But I can only hope that this film will be remembered for many years.
Do not prod me with mere technicalities regarding the race of the principal players.
These are expectations of modern times when we are obsessed with utter perfection.
Time will not diminish this effort nor will progress improve upon its greatness.
This adaptation of Pearl S.
There is only one thing that irks me.
I think you can.
Murray Abraham as Mechanic.
Then there is Luise Rainer.
There is a small grain of truth in that.
But that is Hollywood.
The locust scene was very well shot and contained convincing special effects.
My main problem with the film is that it goes on too long.
Faithful to the work of Pearl S.
The newly found wealth transforms Wang Lung.
I watched it again last night having not seen it since high school.
The novel which earned Ms.
The film is in Black and White and is wonderfully adapted from the novel.
Highly recommended for all audiences.
The special effects and costumes are very good for the time period.
I am surprised that Luise Rainer received an Oscar for such a limiting role.
The rest of her literary output never matched The Good Earth.
Still Rainer stoically bears it all.
Till then we have got this great classic to appreciate and enjoy.
I watched this movie with some curiosity.
I was happily proved wrong.
I watched this film from beginning to end enthralled.
That was astounding to view.
The movie is 67 years old.
9 out of 10.
So can those checking out Oscar winner Julie Christie.
This movie has been poorly received and badly reviewed.
Its a delicate story.
It is SHE who is notified that Chris is back in England.
Gray comes to tell her that Chris is in a hospital in London.
He wants to renew his relationship with Margaret.
They both are in love with him.
Jenny wants to help.
He walks dejectedly toward the house.
The novel was written something after the first war.
This one stays with you forever.
All in all an excellent movie.
The best thing I take from it is Hope.
Sir Ian Holm has a smaller role as the doctor treating him.
The movie itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series.
The way he finds a Christmas dinner partner left me giddy with joy.
There is nothing fake or pretentious about them.
Two great comedians in a great Neil Simon movie based on his hit play.
As each of his employees leave he invites them to a Christmas dinner.
Each and everyone of them politely turn him down.
They all have plans for their own Christmas eve.
At this stage there is a deep sadness to this moving scene.
Thankfully we have a happy denouement to this very special scene.
Every time I see this scene it moves me.
This film is a joy from beginning to end.
The script is a masterpiece of comedy and drama.
It moves effortlessly from scene to scene.
All the acting is magnificent.
Some of her other films are worth catching.
His moment of truth is very moving.
Gold stars all round to the performers.
I was amazed at this movie.
Every time I watch this movie I am more impressed by the whole production.
which is highly believable to boot.
Special mention must be given to the other members of the cast as well.
a wallet instead of that ludicrous cigarette box Clara is so hung up on.
They are the type of character actors that Hollywood sadly no longer employs.
Just as good with repeat viewings.
This is a beautiful movie that is wonderfully acted by all players.
It will make you laugh and it will make you cry.
The very end of the movie gets me to mist up every time.
His accent mixed in with all the other European accents would have been nothing.
But is only this one where neither of them dies.
He makes himself very scarce.
Sad that it pays off a good deal of the time.
I particularly like William Tracy as Pepi.
Theirs is one of the classic love stories of the cinema.
Calling this a romantic comedy is accurate but nowadays misleading.
Jimmy Stewart is a special favorite of mine.
You can guess the rest.
A one of a kind film.
Willy clearly has been living there too long.
Willy wakes up and picks up the phone.
A remarkable achievement and one of the ten greatest screen comedies ever made.
This is a movie that gets better each time I see it.
There are so many nuanced performances in this.
Very believable in every facet of his role.
This movie belongs to Jimmy Stewart though.
This is a great example of that.
It will leave a smile on your face for days.
I thought this film was just about perfect.
There are scenes that will make you laugh out loud .
a few where you will want to get up and tango .
and many others where you will just feel good.
many more would like to than do but are inhibited by the culture.
I understand that it was more popular than Titanic in Japan.
I approached this film with low expectations but was very pleasantly surprised.
The cultural contrasts are thus intriguing.
Such is the premise of this hilarious Neil Simon play made into a movie.
I think you have to slide it.
The story is engaging.
No one is more surprised when he begins to like it than he.
But he must keep his secret pleasure from his coworkers and family.
When the truth comes out it is quite funny.
It is not the same as the other films about dancing.
A few normal people found themselves from dancing.
They are someone that you may see everyday in your offices.
This touches me very deeply.
The object of his obsession is distant and cold.
They are friendly and warm and inviting.
The movie has so many funny moments.
They are two funny character actors.
I recommend this film to all.
I lived in Tokyo for 7 months.
I always look forward to this movie when its on TV.
The range of different types of people is great.
My favorite character must be Mr.
He is so quirky but so full of emotions.
It is a perfect movie with wonderful dancing.
Unfortunately we never get the chance to see them go to Blackpool.
Would make for the perfect sequel if they had.
But I guess it leaves it to your imagination to what could of happened.
A very simple and innocent story.
He stays loyal to his wife and daughter.
Not sure if I want to.
I do not really enjoy Jennifer Lopez.
I have a feeling that the remake is not as simple and innocent.
The choreography was beautiful without seeming athletic.
This film is truly a keeper.
Over 20 years later they agree to get together for a TV special.
but find out they STILL hate each other.
Also his character here is so caustic you get sick of him quickly.
All that aside this was fun.
Their verbal battles are the best sequences in the movie.
For me it is worth seeing for Burns alone.
I give it a 7.
Rather Billy Elliot like I would say.
I enjoyed that film as well.
This movie was charming.
An accountant wants more from life than the approved conventional success.
We can all see ourselves in the everyman.
It is a classic in every sense of the word.
The movie is hysterically funny and yet quite touching all at the same time.
and I think most people will too.
My vote is ten.
As you can see this is one of my favorite if not favorite films.
This is a character drama which is absolutely hilarious.
I saw it last night and woke up today thinking about it.
he knows not precisely what.
It adds to the humor as well as warmth of this movie.
Each does there part in making this movie wonderful.
Truly a well written film.
10 out of 10.
Definitely one of my desert island films.
All these makes it a moving and fun film to watch.
he is fascinated by her and eventually signs up for dancing lessons.
He is ashamed of his dancing and afraid of ridicule.
This movie helped me to understand the Japanese people a little better.
It is a warm and very worthwhile film to see.
I was so surprised when I saw this film so much underrated.
I understand why some of you dislike this movie.
I must say this is the best comedy I have ever seen.
The plot is straightforward yet pleasing.
Before I watched the film I was slightly depressed due to heavy schoolwork.
It is important to note that the actors are not professional dancers.
It definitely deserves 10 stars.
I simply love this movie.
Please do not confuse the two movies.
The Hollywood version is the exact opposite.
The remake cements the argument that some foreign films can never be improved upon.
And please DO skip the US remake.
it is a shallow travesty in comparison to the original Japanese movie.
Yet it is also dignified in a way hard to describe.
It just so happened a friend lent me the video on learning to dance.
Very entertaining and definitely recommended.
I saw this at about 2.
Overall a good film.
So we went instead to see this movie.
I'm still thinking about it.
Even the small parts are great.
Scenes in car and scenes in the mountains are breathtaking.
There is no Dietrich.
I think I truly love this film .
The film seems to focus a lot on men ogling beautiful women.
But at the center of it all is the magnificent Louise Brooks.
I do not know if their projection speed is correct.
A lot of the scenes appear to be shown at too fast a speed.
This may have been the way they were shot.
I do not know.
and the tale might very well have been ended there.
but the true tragedy is that they do love each other.
But it is the images that remain.
The print on this version looked very clear and full of nice contrast though.
This is silent film technique at its pinnacle.
All of the characters are drawn with nuance.
I doubt it is ever been done better.
This is really some of the best stuff of the early days of film.
We are all the poorer for that.
This movie is less well known than her German films with G.
A sense of tragedy to triumph to tragedy again.
All in all I have seen this film at least 10 times.
And then they discover what they have been doing.
Crosby and Martin sing terrifically.
Good job by all.
A surprisingly original plot and great entertainment.
and what a combo.
This film touched my heart.
What happens here is pretty hilarious.
Burns brought a bit of the personal into this film as well.
Or at least pretty close to as an active performer.
And I do think you will like The Sunshine Boys.
Shakespeare said that we are actors put into a great stage.
It is really worth watching.
Big brawl and Maggie ends up stuck in Panama.
Carole and Arthur are great together.
Maggie is always there for him whenever he needs her.
I definitely recommend it.
Good timing and clever banter at the beginning.
The movie has fantastic montage sequences that dazzled me.
They are very good.
It is worth a look.
I do not know its exact rank though.
I suspect it just dates too much now to be well liked.
Most of the scores he worked with were fairly mediocre.
But the rest of the score for MURDER AT THE VANITIES was forgettable.
Nice way to keep the action going while the dialog hits a dull bit.
You can literally hear the script crackle.
But it is really more a matter of adjusting to the different style.
Once you get into the characters it will win over most intelligent viewers.
The series provided Cox with an outstanding supporting cast.
Peepers who seems a much better match for the gentle Nancy.
and even the corny ones are fun.
I must have been only 11 when Mr Peepers started.
Marion Lorne stole the show every time she was on screen.
I still remember it as wonderful and wish I had been a little older.
In 1952 i was 5 and my family always watched this show.
Peepers walking away with his back to the camera.
I think that the movie was kind of weird.
I give it about a 5 out of 10 of the scale.
The ending is a welcomed break from the predictable upbeat endings of most movies.
Not a bad word to say about this film really.
The score is a beautiful piece of suspense delivering apparatus.
All of this is high praise for a good slasher film in my book.
7 out of 10.
There are many reasons why I said that.
You will really enjoy it.
I'm getting chest pains Uncle Willie.
But he seems far happier in accepting his retirement.
The original bits that Hal Sparks did were hilarious.
I think I hold this show in good company.
I love the scathing review of pop culture that this show gives.
They are obviously being ironic.
And that is part of what makes this show funny.
We want more funny writings by the best writer ever Stan Evans.
The patron Saint of the mindless masses.
He should make many more movies.
We wish him a moment of FAME with a great fortune to gain.
He could also write a TV movie about the late KING OF POP.
Thank you so very much.
I recommend this movie to everyone.
My daughter was fascinated by the movie.
We have made it a part of our library.
One night I stumbled upon this on the satellite station Bravo.
Initially out of curiosity i decided to watch it.
The main character is beautiful and her body is shown off well.
The music used is pretty tense and creates the perfect atmosphere for the executions.
A movie you start watching as a late night cable porn.
It is hot in that department but it has even a lot more.
It has a sense of humor.
A definite adult only movie but well worth watching.
And what a way to go.
It starts out real slow.
It gets better as it moves along.
And ends with a bang.
I just recently started watching it and I love it.
Its a show that could of gone as far as Friends went.
This should of lasted much more than year as it was fantastic.
Amazing show with all the best actors.
The first misconception by people is that this is a horror film.
It is a psychological thriller.
It is for people who actually want an intellectual experience when watching a movie.
Kudos to the acting as well.
This movie is worth it.
Forget that Brendan is a graduate of the Buffy universe.
He IS acting here.
And it is twisty.
This would be a good choice for a Saturday Midnight sit down.
The score just plain sucked.
She carries the film squarely on her shoulders.
This is not to say that it is a masterpiece.
UNHOLY ultimately collapses under the weight of its own ambition.
A little ambition is not a bad thing.
A hilarious Neil Simon comedy that evokes laughs from beginning to end.
I have been looking for the name of this film for years.
I was 14 when I believe it was aired on TV in 1983.
I never tire of this fantastic movie.
I have been looking for this for years.
I believe it may have been shown on CBS under yet another title.
I have no idea whether it was ever released on video.
You will not be sorry.
It is unbelievable that anyone could survive under such conditions.
This is why this movie is so appealing.
Most important was her will to survive and to maintain a positive attitude.
It also should be shown more often on the satellite movie channels.
That was a bit far fetched.
I give a 9 of 10.
And so I really love this movie.
It even had a decent twist of an ending.
The ensemble cast has some good moments in the film.
A wonderful surprise of the Spanish cinema.
However this film was absolutely fantastic and not predictable at all.
I'm disappointed at the lack of posts on this surprising and effective little film.
I highly recommend it.
It is an incredible story of a strong and devoted people.
The Sunshine Boys is one of my favorite feel good movies.
Now a lot of the reviews here mentioned the wonderful performances of the leads.
He opens the plays out without making them look like a photographic stage play.
For example the movie showed Joseph Smith on trial.
Then Joseph was killed.
Historically Joseph Smith was never convicted of anything.
Brigham Young was in Boston when Joseph Smith was arrested for this particular trial.
It portrays the trial of Joseph Smith.
I would love to know whether Mormons believe that this is an accurate portrayal.
The issue is not emphasized.
Not a bad martial arts film.
Fight scenes were good.
Story worked without foul language and too much blood.
IT would be great to see something else from her in the same genre.
IT was definitely worth watching.
I recommend the film to all drama and martial arts lovers.
He and his wife make a great team.
She also did good job editing the film.
Together they did a great job.
A new one on me.
The fighting was more in the streets and had looting and crime.
I watched it and fast forwarded through the musical numbers.
But I strongly recommend this film to educators and their students to understand.
I bought this cheap from the rental remnant at our local store.
Clearly nobody else had either.
I can not believe my luck.
I will treasure this little find until it wears out.
One day they will make this again on a better budget.
This film reminds me of 42nd Street starring Bebe Daniels and Ruby Keeler.
I wish she was in more movies.
This movie should have a higher rating.
The strange twists in the Vonnegut story are made stranger by odd details.
some of the scenes left out of the film are part of my memory.
Standing alone and of itself it is well worth a look.
They beat him and leave him in the mud.
His house front and mailbox are painted with swastikas and accusations.
Eichmann seems pleasant enough.
You must learn to relax.
The reason he stopped is that he simply has no place to go.
What Vonnegut is describing is far more than depression.
no role is treated to a less than stellar performance.
But it is also just a really strong feat of cinematic technique.
And the music selections rise the level of tragedy.
It will change you if you do.
One of the best films I have ever seen.
He did a wonderful job of making a character really come to life.
He makes great job expressing the feelings from the book to the film.
Campbell who was a double agent working in propaganda during World War II.
When it is necessary to shout he roars like a wounded lion.
Of course it is also just a sign of the times we live in.
Had Chaplin lived in our times.
Of course on the outset it appears preposterous.
Back to the plot.
the premises of the film make you wonder about a lot of things.
What great movies should be.
A bit long but worth it.
But the film brought me a pleasant surprise.
I recommend it to everyone who is bored with Hollywood spy movies.
American playwright Howard W.
Perhaps that is the best reaction we could hope for.
And he realizes that.
One of my most favorite films.
The film adaptation is very faithful to the original book.
Mother Night has tight direction and a solid cast.
Sheryl Lee is beautiful and great as always.
I always thought she deserved better than she got out of the entertainment industry.
No weaknesses in this fine adaptation.
This movie pleasantly surprised me.
I highly recommend it for audiences who want something thoughtful.
This movie was one of my attempts.
I was in awe throughout the entire movie.
This is a very thoughtful and emotionally striking movie.
This question weighs heavily on the viewer of this movie.
These are qualities that seem natural from him.
Clear shades of things to come abound throughout the cartoon.
The early Bugs was definitely more sassy and cruel than his later incarnations.
It is an understatement to say that the performances are all Outstanding.
His trademark style of acting works well for the sly Puss in Boots.
The other actors are well for their parts.
I did not find any of the acting terribly fake or awkward.
I can not remember the original tale.
James Newton Howard enhances the quality of any film he composes for tenfold.
Show this movie to your daughters.
It will end up becoming a lifetime comfort film.
extremely touching and almost life altering.
was for me at least.
Definitely worth seeing and buying .
Added to my favorite movie list.
it is number one now.
This is a very touching movie that all people should see.
The Man in the Moon.
we will it is just incredible.
But it really is incredible.
just watch it because it will alter the way some people look at life.
Reese Witherspoon first outing on the big screen was a memorable one.
I thought this movie was very well done.
It was well cast and believable.
After the movie was over I wished there was a part two.
I wanted to know what happened to Dani and her family.
This movie is bound to be a classic.
I thought this was a very good movie.
I seem to find myself watching it every time it comes on.
My favorites run from Blue Velvet to Dr.
This sweet tale shortly will be in our private library.
This moving story is one you will enjoy reliving time and again.
The simple virtues evinced in Man in the Moon are a joy to behold.
i must say this movie is truly amazing and heartwarming.
however it is even sweeter watching how much he cares for Dani.
but the biggest tragedy i have ever seen occurred in this movie.
watching him die made me cry for a whole day.
i just could not believe it.
they really can make it through anything.
The movie paints an accurate picture of the South and the racist attitudes.
This movie should have gotten more notoriety.
I was so surprised by how great The Man In The Moon truly was.
7 out of 10 stars.
The plot and the acting was top notch.
You are emotionally involved with the characters.
The other cast members do a great job also.
The movie flows extremely well.
There is not a boring moment in the whole picture.
A young man named Court is loved by everyone.
His painful bloody death brings everyone closer.
You can find other symbols and allusions throughout the movie.
But the elements for this are set up subtly.
Note what his mom says about bringing his lunch out to the field.
Note how he is holding the steering wheel and his gloves.
He is sweaty and operating dangerous equipment.
All the acting is superb.
For some reason I found Jason London on a tractor funny.
Let me begin by expressing my admiration for a perfect portrayal by Reese Witherspoon.
That her performance stands out in the excellent cast is praise indeed.
Robert Mulligan has seldom disappointed those of us who have admired his work.
One of those movies that should become a classic for all.
The girls then are made to realize how much they need each other.
You get to know the characters quickly and experience their ups and downs.
This movie could take place in any farm or rural setting.
The story and the messages it includes would remain the same.
Not paying attention and carelessness gets you into dangerous situations.
The second reason is that is a love triangle.
As if it all really happened.
Love story or not.
this is what this movie is all about.
He has been thrust responsibility when he should be having fun.
They yell and argue and Danni leaves.
One look between the two and its all over.
This movie has since the first time I watched it stuck in my mind.
Its in the my Top 100 movie list and deservedly so.
my faith in Hollywood would be a lot better.
It is very touching at times and is very well done in all respects.
Jason London does a fine job as well.
The rest of the cast was very good as well.
As I watched this movie I began to feel very nostalgic.
Through the pain we go through in life.
life goes on and there can be forgiveness.
Feel free to cry.
This was truly a heartbreaking story about first love.
Probably the most painful story about young love that I have ever seen.
I would give The Man in the Moon 8.
Warfield and London are both equally good as well.
This is one of the very best films of 1991.
Perfect movies are rare.
What a delightful movie.
This show is good.
It was as if Pushing Daisies Brought ABC back to life for me.
Pushing Daisies truly is a landmark in Television as an art form.
It is just Brilliant.
Truly addictive and an absolute pleasure.
And Pushing Daisies lives up to those expectations.
I suppose everything does come back to money.
I have loved it since.
He learned this when his mother kissed him goodnight.
But this does point out a problem with continuing story lines in network dramas.
Many of these other viewers complain that the story line has already been attempted.
The investigative portion of the show is not what drags viewers in.
This is a success that ABC should never let go of.
9 episodes prior to the writers strike left audiences wanting more.
I love this show.
I like the storybook quality of the cinematography.
The movie has its tear jerking parts as well.
It is what real life can be in such an environment.
I am not sure whether his presence as narrator adds or distracts.
Maybe that is a good thing.
He can not send her back and he can never touch her.
Thank god ABC picked this up instead of Fox.
Most of the characters have a longing for things they can not have.
I think the characters are picture perfect and believable.
I really enjoyed the first episode and am looking forward to more.
Her character is very sweet and lovable and you easily get attached to her.
Lee Pace does a great job too.
Two underrated character actresses that never fail to bring it with their performances.
I have been a fan of Pushing Daisies since the very beginning.
You really connect with these characters.
It really is that good.
OK so one more thing.
This show is clever.
It is a pleasure to see such creativity on TV again.
Definitely worth a look.
The girls steal the show so far in this series.
Chuck is adorable as is Olive.
The two aunts are a delight.
I sincerely hope they write them into bigger parts as they are magic.
This is like Dr.
She has been missing from the screen for far too long.
If you grew up in an Italian American family you will love this movie.
Jim Dale brings all the characters together with his wonderful narration of the show.
Pushing Daisies quickly made it to the top of my list.
And that bringing them back to life was just as routine.
The truly kiss of death.
And that is how this beautiful modern fairytale starts.
The results could not be better.
The world around The Pie Hole was magnificent.
The actors here are top of note.
This makes every show I have ever watched look plain boring.
but I enjoyed this show anyway.
I will mourn its passing.
But I guess nobody will be bringing this back to life.
Pushing Daisies was a wonderful show.
There is nothing random about the choices that are made from costume to leitmotif.
An escape from the mundane and boring.
Watch a weirdly natural and totally satisfying song break out of a scene.
I know I do not.
I had a heart attack about a year and a half ago.
I wish she could have the comfort a strong faith gives.
It also showed the strong faith of two families who were first generation witnesses.
Thank you for this movie and allowing comments on it.
This adaptation of M.
I give it 7 out of 10.
And it was a great introduction.
The best film of Martial Law series.
It is a rare occasion when I want to see a movie again.
In old time movie theaters I would have stayed put for more showings.
The all star cast present their characters believably and with tenderness.
I was impressed by this film.
Pretty good for a sequel and I never even seen the first.
I enjoyed this version much more then the Spielberg version I saw last week.
So well done for at least trying to make a true version.
Its greatest fault is that it was obviously made on a very cheap budget.
The overviews of 1898 London look like something from a video game.
I was particularly impressed with the heat ray.
The acting and direction will not win any Oscars.
The year 2005 saw no fewer than 3 filmed productions of H.
The acting is often more in the style of that period than ours.
If you want to see H.
but any way i give this movie 2 thumbs up.
They will explain the processes used.
It is totally refreshing to me to have this movie in my library.
The tripods look pretty cool but their walking and deaths could have been better.
The action scenes were really cool.
Good movie I recommend it for people ho have read the book.
The music is awesome and the directors cut looks pretty cool.
some bad acting cheesy looking London.
Wells Classic has had several Incarnations.
Nothing is changed nothing is removed.
Martians Invade the Earth with Capsules containing an army of Tripod walking War Machines.
This move brought back so many pleasant memories.
People really did walk places back then.
The actors are likable and the performances are charming.
Hines succeeds in doing so.
We enjoyed the effort Mr.
Hines put into being faithful to H.
You can poke holes in the plot if you want.
Now imagine yourself sharing this gift with the love of your life.
Spock receives an urgent message from the former commander of the Enterprise.
Spock turns himself in to Dr.
Pike was commanding and Spock was one of his officers.
The kept her entertained and happy the entire time.
My son has been watching them for over a year.
This show is by far the best show on TV for kids.
AND a rock band for children.
The acting was Superb and the Story was Marvelous.
This is wonderful medicine for the heart and soul.
The Acting could not have been better nor the movie better cast.
At any rate this was an Amazing cast.
It obviously was at the Academy Awards as well.
preferably own this film.
They always have a positive message along with fun entertainment.
Moe is a great dancer.
Our favorite song is The Bird Song.
This guy must have been a cheerleader or something.
Must have 10 lines of text so I must continue.
I really enjoyed this movie.
Heath Ledger is great as always and the sexy Naomi Watts charms the screen.
Give this movie a chance if it airs on cable.
I do see what my forebears saw in the youthful Bette Davis.
This is a good movie for those of us who love these old comedies.
He had me fooled.
He seemed more like an empty canvas than a person.
But Warren William and Bette Davis are well worth watching.
I thought it was good.
Some of the score was actually good.
A bad ending I must say but I did see it coming.
it seemed that the movie was researched well.
I do not go along with the crowd of right wing believers.
I dropped out of that atmosphere.
I call it the Judas Syndrome.
This film certainly showed some of that.
Also he was a very gorgeous Jesus.
Another is that of the historical nature of the Bible and faith.
One to excite all 5 senses.
This movie is one of the most provocative Jesus movies I have ever seen.
I would watch this movie again and recommend it to others.
Monarch Cove updated this concept quite well and I anticipated it only getting better.
Love the TV show.
Was hooked first time I saw it.
Wish I was there acting in with them.
You are in a situation were you have to choose one or the other.
Making the decision that you really want will be better in the end.
Making the best of what you have is a good thing a well.
i am totally addicted to this show.
i can not wait till the week goes by to see the next showing.
it is suspenseful and exciting.
i am really mean it.
There are tons of memorable quotes.
Eugene Levy also turns in a hilarious performance as a sleazy filmmaker.
all fantastic films that are mildly inaccurate historically.
and they bounce HARD.
You should not take what I am about to say lightly.
No movie has ever done that to me before.
I remember it being announced.
They never really stood much of a chance.
Some scenes just do not seem to make sense after others.
I'm surprised to see the rating here as low as it is.
They must have just told him not to in the Matrix movies.
This is really a great unknown movie.
I especially loved the interracial aspects of it all.
Now onto the actors themselves.
Once in the Life is for sure a keeper.
Since I think this is his directorial debut it might prove even more interesting.
All of the acting is quite good.
every sentiment mirrored in the set dressing and camera shots.
Orlando Bloom and Naomi Watts were also really good and believable.
And the hunter and dogs are terrified of Casper.
Ferdie starts licking Casper on his cheek.
Casper screams for joy because he has been reunited with Ferdie.
You have to give them credit.
The finale is a bit heartbreaking.
I would give this cartoon 8 out of 10 stars.
Second only to the Warner Bros.
I have often wondered just how much CASPER was meant for children.
But it grabbed me from the start.
The best and most unpredictable stories are all true ones.
That is not what this film is.
This was a gem.
It was interesting to watch the moral choices people were making in this story.
Again acting is a top notch.
Irish countryside is as beautiful as ever.
And makes no mistake here.
An excellent film all round.
Both stars were in attendance and were available for questions afterward.
As for the stars and supporting players.
The film is a fascinating insight into the whole issue of religion in Ireland.
In this case both let this family down.
There are many episodes that I enjoyed.
I really like this show.
I learned this from people on the show.
I really like this show.
I learned this from people on the show.
From the beginning of the show Carmen was there.
She was one of the best characters.
The best episodes were with Carmen in them.
She was an awesome actress.
Way better than the niece.
But this show is a work of art.
George Lopez is funny.
His outbursts and shouts of glee are hilarious.
I hate the character.
George Lopez is a funny man even without the sitcom.
No one on the cast is really safe from his wit now.
The whole concept about a Latin family TV show really amazed me.
I am surprised that finally Latinos have a good shot to be on TV.
I will stop here to avoid the spoiler.
I think this movie deserves a broader audience than it has received.
But this movie is a dramatic powerhouse.
I was all in sweat and needed a shower afterward.
Well worth your while.
The only reason I wanted to see this was because of Orlando Bloom.
The direction is competent and assured.
The story is plodding.
His portrayal of this was just amazing.
His soliloquies were breathtaking.
I recommend this to anyone both fan of Shakespeare and those not so much.
This leaves no stone unturned.
I can not think of many better ways to make four hours fly by.
I was completely engrossed from start to finish.
One can only feel a deep sense of satisfaction after having seen this.
This is as close to perfection as you can hope to get.
William Shakespeare would be very proud of this particular version of his play.
He outdoes himself with Hamlet.
I guess they know good writing when they see it though.
To say that the technical aspects were awesome would be an understatement.
This is the biggest problem with this production.
Almost everything else works out absolutely beautifully.
And the relationship with Ophelia seems a little forced.
And he gets too hysterical at times.
But that is it.
Every frame is a painting.
I went to see Hamlet because I was in between jobs.
Like other reviews the 4 hours passes swiftly.
This movie was shot in 70 mil.
This is the definitive movie version of Hamlet.
I was also surprised at how mediocre this movie was.
and that is the only reason to see it.
I was not disappointed.
So true to Shakespeare and yet so accessible.
It blew my mind.
But now on to the movie.
I would recommend this movie to a wide audience.
Kenneth plays the role of Hamlet with such a distinct emotion that provokes tears.
This was my favorite performance of the year by far.
encrypted with his extremely difficult to understand language.
Well let me tell you something.
And here I was my mind opening and me understanding it.
I understood what was going on.
What was being said.
The language is awesome and passionate.
It allows for more raw emotion.
No movie provides more sheer entertainment.
It was an event.
Powerful is the word.
This gets 2 hundred trillion stars out of infinity stars.
You are wasting you are time.
You have to see the plays performed.
Only then will justice be done to them.
Too many of them outstay their welcome.
All play their parts equally well.
This is a must see for anyone and everyone.
Personally i agree upon all those superlatives that are around.
It has a few quick inappropriate scenes but is all right other than that.
The language is very mild and sometimes do not even know it is there.
I hope that people will watch this movie and get interested as I have.
The acting was not really up to the Hamlet standard.
I have got to say one more thing though.
For the same reason his plays are full of anachronisms.
Even Billy Crystal as a gravedigger works.
Every moving and charming sequence leaves behind a comprehensive sense of satisfaction.
His dedication to stay true to the original text should be applauded.
D to understand and enjoy it.
He convinces Aggie to become his fiancé.
The production values are high and the script is very elegantly written.
I was swept up in the moment.
These guys make films.
this is one of the funniest shows i have ever seen.
it is really refreshing to watch and i was in stitches many times.
my favorites is the bob the builder one.
it is so silly it is genius.
if you like twisted black comedy then this is for you.
The Christmas specials were hilarious and a real treat for Christmas.
This film was amazing.
I am extremely picky about the films I see.
I would heard about Moon Child completely by accident.
The reason is because it involves vampires doing incredible stunts.
I think that it is a really good movie to watch.
Several scenes can be so fun and some others are so sad.
This is an action movie with a touching beautiful story.
Moon Child was one of the more symbolic movies I have seen.
I personality quite like that moral the movie depicted on.
It is quite a thoughtful film and also entertaining to watch.
The other area that really stood out to me is the languages.
Possibly the most amusing exchange involves an Australian and is conducted in English.
This movie is amazing.
The plot was just.
The storyline was thick with twists and turns and very entrancing.
The special effects are pretty good considering the small budget.
It works great as a stand alone Vampire movie.
9 out of 10.
Before long disaster again strikes and the group falls apart.
Alliances turn to enemies and their worlds are all turned upside down.
Regrets and hopelessness claim some while power and success take others.
Tragedy claims still others.
Truths are revealed and lives are forever changed.
And you will never see a more beautiful sunrise.
Nothing could possibly compare.
I went looking for this movie in typical fan obsession.
I just wanted to check it out.
I was not expecting much of anything.
The story plucks at your emotions and pulls you along.
I completely recommend this movie.
I was not disappointed.
A lot of angst.
I have watched it over and over again.
The music is also amazing.
A surprise ending that grips as much as the whole movie does.
I voted 8 for this movie because of some minor childish flaws.
It seems like their enemies just stands there.
waiting to get shot at.
he shows so much emotion.
The role fits him.
Wang Lee Hom is absolutely great.
Hyde did an amazing job for a first timer.
The way they met up was quite cool indeed.
The ending scene showed it to us.
Never has a movie touched me the way this movie do.
A big praise to the editor for creating this masterpiece.
This is a must see.
This movie is really special.
This is absolutely one of my favorite movies.
You will not regret it.
Many of the buildings he visited in his life are still standing.
I ranked it at a 9 out of 10 at first.
Came up with nothing.
So a ten out of ten it is.
You can tell what side I'm on with Moon Child.
Effects lack consistency but action scenes are satisfying enough.
It puts you to think and it does well transmitting all the angst.
It fulfills any expectations for a good drama.
I would definitely recommend it to everyone.
At least rent it since it is coming to Region 1.
The characters all had human traits.
I give this movie two thumbs so far up.
Definitely the best movie I have seen in the past five years.
You can create the goal pedestrian and write what they speak.
This is the sort of motion picture that begs for a remake.
It might be possible to do it almost as good.
This is one of the very best that Hollywood EVER produced.
it gets no better.
The Invisible Ray is their best.
In this entry the dominant role goes to Boris Karloff.
The contamination causes his skin to emit a bright glow in the dark.
Diana and Ronald accompany him.
One night he is lured into a trap set by Benet and.
See it and you WILL NOT be sorry.
The two fiends will battle over the radiations possibilities.
Pretty good special effects.
Karloff slightly overdoes his performance but Lugosi is terrific.
The Invisible Ray is a sombre and clever little film with much to admire.
Check the hysterical chambermaid scene.
Still I did like this.
I give it a 7.
Very swift story with an unpredictable end.
This is about the best of its genre that I have ever seen.
A grade A effort by Universal.
Director Lambert Hillyer handled the complex story and story locations very well.
No skimping on the loads of extras and locations.
Lugosi likewise was correctly underplayed.
I think this is the best part I remember seeing him in.
Boris Karloff plays Dr.
Bela Lugosi plays Dr.
Rarely are they both negative characters totally.
What he gets is a disaster.
But there are two things that are unbeatable here.
The film certainly picked up on science to an extent.
Madame Curie had died recently from cancer she got due to work with Radium.
It turned out he only got the photographs of the retinas of dead prostitutes.
But the idea did not die.
His already loner personality becomes unbearable as he becomes paranoid.
This is a perfectly delightful movie to watch again and again.
The acting is marvelous and the science is amusing.
I highly recommend it.
Director Lambert Hillyer captures a lot of elements that James Whale did so often.
What I'm saying is that this film is eerie and well shot.
But no can forget it.
The story is elegant.
It also contains some wonderful lines.
And what I see frightens me.
This movie is definitely desert island material.
Halfway through Karloff simply has an added purpose for revenge in his mind.
This is one of those moments.
and are absolutely perfect for this very funny film.
They start robbing banks and even hijack an entire town for 3 days.
I really enjoyed this movie and I give it a 7.
All the actors are perfectly cast and they are all great supporting actors.
Robert Wagner played his role good.
and Turner was a nice one.
There maybe a big age difference there but they are a unique couple.
The two actors really worked together rather well.
The book is better.
It was interesting to say the least.
Overall I would give the movie a 7 or 8.
the acting in it and the plot was just so great.
I married a Japanese woman 14 years ago.
We are still together.
The mixed relationships gave it new ground to cover.
This touched on both possibilities along with the third.
Garner did a better job than he usually does.
The real scene stealer was Red Buttons.
Red was the best thing in this film.
And the Japanese lifestyles were shown in an admirable light as well.
It certainly inspired me to look more closely.
This movie highlights the prejudices and cultural differences of that time.
This is one of the greatest love story movies I have ever seen.
The Jim Crow laws were still in effect.
Civil Rights was in it is infancy.
Anyone who has been in Japan would understand.
It touched every emotion from anger to romance to complete tragedy.
And Brando should have won for best actor.
This movie manages to say SOMETHING and be entertaining at the same time.
A mostly underrated gem.
boy gets girl back.
The weakest role goes to the late Kent Smith as Lt.
Red Buttons is great.
I always love seeing comedians in dramatic roles.
Today gays in the military is a big issue.
Joshua Logan was on familiar ground.
South Pacific also had racism as a component of its plot.
But the picture is stolen by the orientals here.
Buttons is your everyman enlisted man Air Force member.
They marry and the military cruelly does everything they can to break them up.
I still carry the memory of it.
That Oscar symbolized something else too.
Good location photography and a grand story.
This film should be revived more often it has a great moral.
Dooley does not get along with his new partner much either.
That all changes as the movie goes along.
Fortunately it made for an enjoyable quirk of a film.
The tag line holds true as well.
I thought it was a very funny movie.
I love dog movies and comedy movies so combined they were twice as good.
Realizing that all the Dog vs.
The film is a little unevenly paced.
The script is intelligent and economical.
Jeff Corey and many other townspeople try to dispose of the invading mole men.
A must see for anyone.
But as a kid I enjoyed it.
Usual acting in these type movies leaves a lot to be desired.
Walter Reed and Jeff Corey were familiar faces as well from other movies.
He did a great job of playing the strong man.
to mention a few.
People are being too hard on the film.
I think it is an excellent interpretation of what may well have occurred.
I would love to get a copy of it to view it again.
The allusions to J.
Comedian Les Dawson later spoofed this opening in his B.
This is a great movie.
There is no special agency involved in the plot.
All can be done just by delegation.
I think enough of it to have a copy in my library.
He also runs a Carnival and is the head clown.
and cleverly put together.
Give this one a look.
That seems impossible to say the least.
The fight between the brothers near the end of the movie was brilliant though.
Found this one in the video store and rented it.
If you enjoyed that movie you will most likely enjoy this one.
The soundtrack is great also.
York was never changed by the war the way Tone has.
I think you can figure the rest out.
In fact the whole film has a darkly cool energy and hip intensity.
But I love that.
you are in for a treat.
The people who bash this movie make no sense.
I'm in the latter group.
This film for all of its excellence is made even richer by additional viewings.
com 15 June 2008.
I absolutely love this picture.
I think this is the best film they could have made with the material.
It certainly helps to have read the original text before viewing the film.
But the story is great.
My daughter was entranced.
I would watch it again with my daughter.
He loved being bearer so much he came to regard himself as practically British.
The excellent opening theme was penned by Jimmy Perry and Derek Taverner.
The show hit crisis point three years later when Bates died of cancer.
Thank heavens for D.
Time to stop this review.
It is about A concert band in India.
and some drug use.
Lots of worrying by the mothers.
A good way to spend 98 minutes.
I wanted to see even more of it.
I appreciate this flowing film very much.
Each family has a gay son.
Maybe some people may consider this a slow movie.
I will always be a fan of the show.
The final season of Roseanne was a roller coaster ride of crazy.
This is what she did with the entire episode.
It has effectively gone where numerous other cop dramas have gone and succeeded.
Give this series the ending it deserves.
A great series which has aged remarkably well.
This is a film that was very well done.
She has quite the career ahead of her.
I was amazed at her performance.
It was good advice.
Read the rest at your own risk of spoiling.
You will be captivated.
It holds your attention from the start and its pace never slows.
The adrenalin rises and you cant not watch.
It also makes you question reality TV and if you would watch.
Now I can easily say this has been a hell of a ride.
Ask yourself would you do it.
This story is still an original plot.
Having a baby sister.
you know how it is.
By now i memorized both the plot and the lines.
the second one was significantly weaker.
It is definitely a good way to spend about an hour and 15 minutes.
There are actually some very funny jokes in the movie.
The voice talents are excellent.
Some of the questions are actually difficult.
Could have been one of the scariest movies if planned for another audience.
Disney have done it again.
I love this film and watch it over and over again.
Walt Disney company has NOT lost his touch maybe not for this one.
However some parts do not fit.
I would recommend it for fans of the original.
I recently saw this movie again after not seeing it in many years.
There are a few jokes that adults can enjoy on their own.
The score is quite good.
Many of the scenes from the first film are used in this one.
The returning voice talent is great.
The music is also great.
I was thinking how dumb is Disney getting.
I found it to be very good.
It was very funny.
Not to give anything way but you will know what I am talking about.
It was a very good movie over all.
Upon viewing I was .
And it is all good.
The team has done some serious research.
Their grandfather is a mariner of sorts.
No submarine was ever found.
This is a bit more subtle.
They also give us a reason to avoid a hot tub with a warthog.
7 out of 10.
8 out of 10.
This is done with frequent comedic interruptions.
We get to see them make fun of the events in the first film.
The Lion King series is easily the crowning achievement in Disney animation.
It deserved a theatrical release.
The same can be said for this movie.
Everything you have come to expect from this series.
The scenes never seem out of place.
There are MANY big laughs in this movie.
The story is just not complete without it.
One of the best movies for all ages.
Take time out and watch this with the kids.
Lemon is in the middle.
This is not a movie to be missed.
Paul Winfield should have won an award for his awesome performance in this movie.
Green Eyes is a great movie.
The dedication of one man towards his lost son is entirely moving.
One of my friends said it was her favorite movie.
I have been searching for it every where.
I have done net searches for it in the past but came up empty.
com I would really appreciate it.
All he knows is that the boy has green eyes.
No movies have grabbed my attention like this one has.
Rating reflects movie content.
something they have grown up with and are quite familiar with.
They start a fairly hard job and excel in no time.
And the dumbest things are usually done to get out of this state.
This movie can be interpreted on many different levels.
It is really mocking psychology and the conditioning of society.
One of the best movies I have ever seen.
The movie is better than the book.
But the movie is just so much better.
But I already talked about those in my comment on the mini series.
But count on having nightmares every night for 3 weeks.
One of the things that adds to the scare factor is the amazing music.
Jack is terrifyingly convincing as a crazy killer.
There will never be a horror movie that quite matches this one.
They are not alone in this place.
It really is great.
The kid is psychic.
Another thing I love is the multiple interpretations present in the film.
We are never really sure if what we are seeing is actually happening.
And that final shot.
And do not even get me started on that score.
Kubrick masterfully alters the narrative to terrify the audience even more.
And it is got everything else on top of that.
This is the highest rated horror film of all and rightly so.
Red is used in EVERY scene.
He loves to perplex his watchers in everyone of his films.
I will be talking about this film for months to come.
It has infinite depth.
A frighteningly authentic portrayal of a mind gone mad.
Damian Lewis and Jessica Lloyd standout among the group.
Take the murder of Mrs.
Jack Nicholson gives an awesome performance.
Kubrick really knows how to convey the terror of the psyche straight to film.
The movie world lost a great director when he died in 1999.
The Hotel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging.
His smiles were natural and his performance was wonderful.
It was believable and sincere.
how messed up Jack is.
Speaking of memorable scenes.
It also goes down in horror movie history.
I felt it ended beautifully.
Certain images definitely stand out.
Playing mad turns him into an exaggerated caricature of himself.
A terrific and very underrated actress.
It has the classic mystery of Hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller.
The Shining is a damn scary movie.
That one toss would have been cinematic tragedy.
I was never a big fan of horror movies.
They usually lack originality and contain overacting galore.
The only horror movie i like was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon.
This film is a perfect example of this very thought.
At the same time it manages to invoke intense emotions of sadness and despair.
I think Via Satellite is one of the best New Zealand made movies around.
I loved the sparring between Jen and Lyn.
Climax of the film is quite sentimental and is nicely done.
The performances are a treat and the film works perfectly.
Some people tend to forget that.
Beautiful film with great acting.
Sometimes a miracle happens.
But it is GOOD crap.
A rare movie to languish within.
Fine central performances too including the indomitable Jack Taylor and Howard Vernon.
quite a bizarre fantasy sequence where mannequins are used rather unusually.
Great locations and jazz score.
I particularly liked the constant namedropping.
More problematic is the incoherency.
I just wanted to see more of the movie.
Since that moment Franco never could grip me that much.
But then I stumbled on this movie.
Franco is looking for what he can do with a story and a camera.
We find out he can do a lot.
But certainly watch out for the dummy scene.
I thoroughly enjoyed this film for its humor and pathos.
Everything that in this film occurs has a symbolic meaning.
It is totally different to the usual movie that one has access.
I must advice that this is not a sample film.
No other movie has made me feel like this before.
and I do not feel bad.
No movie has ever done this to me before.
I do not know.
I truly do not know.
You turn it into an art form.
I thought she did a great job in this.
The supporting cast was pretty good too.
The abductor was pretty creepy and the story generally had some good twists.
I thought the husband definitely had something to do with it for sure.
Just got the Lifetime Movie Network for Christmas and am loving these movies.
Kept my interest and I will watch it again when they rerun it.
His pursuit of May IS the film.
I enjoyed a lot watching this movie.
So he starts trying to find a breast who is able to feed him.
I also enjoyed the performance of the protagonist.
Some people criticize the script for being too wordy.
This wordiness touches the very roots of the genre.
It all wonderfully helped me keep the right pace.
But here do not expect me to praise foremost Romy Schneider.
It is still acted.
Her role is a purely supporting one.
Who really rocks is Lino Ventura.
But thumbs up for Mr Ventura.
New Year has turned and.
I liked the movie a real lot.
A very cool change in plot when you least expect it.
This 1998 film was based on a script by the late Edward D.
This is a classic waiting to be discovered.
This film could find an audience much larger than either of those.
You will NOT be bored.
Invite some friends over.
make it a party.
Play the amazing soundtrack LOUD.
No one is there just to show their face.
A film to make you wish you had made it yourself.
I saw this film at the International Film Festival Of Brussels.
I also met the director of the film.
And this is cool.
This film really surprised me as it is a comedy masterpiece.
It is obvious that the film tries to play with the established formula.
The cast is good.
This was one of those wonderful rare moments in T.
that I wished I would captured forever on VHS.
I want to see it all again.
I want to buy it.
I want what I can not have.
It should be considered a classic but is lost in space.
had a much more intellectual quality to it.
Everything I remember about it was excellent.
I still have 1 episode on a much deteriorated tape.
I can not imagine a movie like this being made in 1967.
This is a film that stays with you after viewing.
I saw this film after watching Capote and Infamous.
we cut to the Clutters.
Nancy Cutter gets an offer to sleep at a friends house.
She is holding a horse.
Perry will comment on a picture of her and the house later on.
The decision seals her fate.
But Dick knows that the protagonists of that film ended up with nothing.
Ironically his mortality is about to end in a few hours.
Dick has said that they wanted no witnesses so nobody would remember them.
I loved her in this.
The Richard character was completely creepy.
I have dated guys like that.
I LOVE these stalker type stories.
It always makes me get up and make sure my doors are locked.
There are two kinds of rules in this world.
The actual events up to and including the murder are saved until the end.
Cutter was a very nice gentleman.
I thought so right up until the time I cut his throat.
Brooks directs with a lot of verve and uses several interesting transitions between scenes.
IN COLD BLOOD is masterfully directed and adapted by Richard Brooks.
Its exceptionally well made yet forces the viewer to think.
The acting from the two leads is terrific.
Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are excellent together as two criminals with disparate personalities.
Richard Brooks received Oscar nominations for both his script and his direction.
Brooks turns the killers into pitiable characters rather than flatly condemning them.
Its surprising how so few people have commented on this movie.
My guess is that its a hard movie to find.
I gave the film a 9.
See the movie and you will know what I'm talking about.
The black and white cinematography and editing in this movie are top notch.
There are simply no flaws in this one.
10 out of 10.
Blake a close second.
Robert Blake was excellent in his portrayal of Perry Smith.
The book was also excellently written by Truman Capote.
Loved it but still have nightmares over the hotel manager.
Many scenes gripped the imagination and created a nail biter.
Too bad there have to be commercials.
I want to thank all who were involved in this great entertainment film.
It really brought to life the excellent acting of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson.
Music from Quincy Jones effectively scores it is story.
I have only seen this a couple times since.
It was too real.
I would give this a 9.
0 of a possible 10.
I am not a psychologist but have known one for 25 years.
I have seen over 2000 films and would rank this in the top 100.
My lifelong friend deals with clients such as these regularly.
My only criticism was the preachy narration at the end of the film.
The result was the book IN COLD BLOOD.
This was a highly combustible scenario in America whereby two entirely different cultures collided.
Easily one of the ten best movies of the 20th century.
Robert Blake walks away with the film.
The story ended in 1965.
one of the best of all time.
The cops are wonderful too.
They seem so real.
Really one of a kind in this respect.
This is some of the best acting you will ever see.
It makes the crime so palpable and sad.
I will stop here.
There are many fine supporting actors.
The result is the finest classic crime movie I have ever seen.
This film could NOT have been made in color.
His breathing under the hood just before they sprung the trap.
I do not think I could watch that again.
they end up murdering Mr.
Clutter and their teenage son and daughter.
Robert Blake is excellent as Perry.
Paul Stewart is very good as Jensen.
Jeff Corey is marvelous as Mr.
Same thing with Charles McGraw who plays Tex Smith.
Great job by each of them.
There is much to remember from this film.
Those darker moments are the most haunting ones.
Then the hanging scene.
She just radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress.
I was a little disappointed with the ending of the movie.
It was a very fitting end for Richard.
Famed photographer Conrad Hall did a fantastic job on this.
One can not help but look at Blake and this film differently after that.
The performances are fine as well.
The Clutter family was apparently not researched to the same depth.
It is unusual to find films made 38 years apart that mesh so well.
These two truly enhance each other.
These two new twists make the film timely for a modern audience.
The flashback scenes to his horrible childhood are extremely well done.
Stunning portrayals by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson.
These roles made their careers.
It excels in every department.
Blake and Wilson turn in stellar performances of the killer duo.
The only sound is the wind whistling through the trees.
Sometime after midnight a car with lights off inches up the driveway.
Moments later an intruder beams a flashlight into your darkened living room.
But this is no dream.
Do you suppose people in rural Kansas still leave their doors unlocked .
A good picture is worth all the words.
And I will not spoil it by telling you.
You will want to see it yourself.
The film has a magic of it is own.
Passion and simplicity is all we need.
Everybody can learn from Georges.
This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I loved Rain Man with Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise.
It is a gift to show it to someone you love.
it was never posted because it was not more than 10 lines.
This is with no doubt in my movie top 3.
The soundtrack is also really good.
I hope it will complete my movie top 3.
Because you will want to see it again.
11 out of 10.
I do not really care for subtitles either.
I found myself laughing out loud repeatedly.
This one makes it worth the effort.
The character development in this film is excellent.
The song that gets played repeatedly also reinforces this message.
The film shows that people who are mentally handicapped are good natured.
It is a touching film for good natured souls.
I know how sentimental I sound and I promise I'm not usually like that.
I'm quite a cynic.
Winning performances from both these actors give this film its main strength.
There are some moments in the story that are very frustrating for Harry.
This is true cinema which touches the heart.
The film itself I believe is quite a masterpiece.
This film is close to be my favorite piece of celluloid.
There is really not much I would need or want to say here.
8 out of 10.
On the eighth day God created Georges.
She was the only one who loved him.
Harry is a highly ranked businessman.
He knows all the rules that enable us to succeed in our modern meritocracy.
Harry and Georges meet.
But Georges can not be shaken off.
Friendship and human warmth take the place of calculating striving for success.
It is no surprise that Harry now can not avoid failing in his job.
Georges helps Harry to regain the recognition of the daughters.
Nonetheless a reintegration into the old life is no longer possible.
This is the French and Belgians doing what they do best.
This film is a monument.
Gregory Peck gives a brilliant performance in this film.
The same can not however be said for the rest of the film.
For the rest you are better off just reading the Old Testament.
But it is also perhaps the first that really humanizes the biblical characters themselves.
Hayward is at her best in this film.
Raymond Massey does a great job as Nathan the prophet.
Finally this film belongs to Gregory Peck who wonderful as King David.
This is one of his best performances.
I think it still holds up very well today.
Despite a script that at times is unintentionally funny the film is highly entertaining.
Raymond Massey as the prophet Nathan delivers his usual saturnine and ferocious performance.
Look for the silent screen star Francis X.
Hooray for the Old Testament and Hollywood.
But his eyes catch sight of Bathsheba out in her garden one evening.
The sexist law of the day calls for Bathsheba to have a stoning death.
The only thing that gets Moore aroused is a good battle.
No one can lay the law down like Raymond Massey.
He would replaced Saul with David already.
I will leave it to the biblical scholars to submit interpretations.
Watch the film and you might come up with an entirely new theory.
To me movies and acting is all about telling a story.
As well as the sadness when he was killed in battle.
I gave it a rating of ten.
But there is something gripping about this movie.
The rest of the cast is stalwart and capable by turns.
She was beautiful and attractive.
David could not take his eyes off her.
He sends the man to the front line where he would be killed.
They storm the palace and demand that Bathsheba pays for her sin.
Peck plays the compassionate king whose lustful desire outweighed his good sense and integrity.
The love triangle causes some strain in their friendship.
After having played the demo however I was sold.
Let me tell you to witness something like that is scary as hell.
This game relies on the character using wits and walking carefully around.
Because like in any horror movie your surroundings are usually pretty dark.
But sadly I have to report that there are some flaws.
For one thing the universe you are playing in is huge.
That is all fine in the beginning.
And there is no map.
The game demands you memorize your surroundings.
So patience is required.
I do not mind jumping on platforms in third person adventures.
But in first person mode that can be an annoying task.
Luckily you can save at anytime and anyplace.
And trust me you will need it.
Great editing and use of the soundtrack.
A well chose cast with some great characters.
This was an adorable movie.
She is definitely a new shining star for Hollywood.
Also impressing was the soundtrack for this movie.
A nice mix of modern and Indian tunes.
I was dancing throughout most of the movie.
Highly recommended if a fun movie is what you need.
But our attractive young star CAN play some serious soccer.
Nice final wrap up to the whole deal.
Watch this movie and enjoy.
What surprised me most about this film was the sheer audience it attracted.
And soccer is the red line in this movie.
Together with the struggle youngsters have with the expectations parents have.
to your destination and you make boundaries and complications.
I can really relate to the main character Jess.
She really sucks you into her life.
The movie is never boring.
Feel good comedies are becoming my favorite movie genre thanks to this film.
I love this movie.
I feel that the cultural struggles are more emphasized than the other issues.
If anything it will make you smile.
No one wants their daughters to be athletes.
The structure around the parallelism of the two cultures is wonderful.
There is no condescension.
Both cultures are seen as modern and valid.
What a moron i was.
I should have seen this film the day it was released.
The trailers looked fun so I thought I would give it a go.
The entire auditorium was laughing out loud every minute or so.
better than East is East.
My beloved but forgotten Ice Junkie had melted into a sugary blue juice.
I only splash out if it is really worth it.
The sound effects and audio are amazing.
But this movie is about so much more.
This movie is so good and so deep.
Almost lights out for me.
This is a movie about living.
Living your life for yourself and respect for others.
The title of this film nearly put me off watching it.
If you liked East is East then you will love this film.
I just never got around to watching it.
The plot has nothing that interests me.
What a fun film.
I had a goofy grin on my face through the whole movie.
No wonder why the American television show E.
has snatched her up.
I have a new appreciation for Indian culture.
Those people know how to have a good time.
The wedding scenes are dazzlingly beautiful.
This is a perfect date film.
I highly recommend it.
If that is what you are looking for go somewhere else.
I think it is thought out well and it is entertaining to watch.
do not watch this movie if your already depressed.
then again do not watch it if your feeling really good.
But its real message is one of love and perseverance.
Made the same year as Philadelphia.
this is the film that people REALLY should have seen and given awards to.
and it is all true.
this is the film to see.
Then it became clear that AIDS would also be a heterosexual disease.
Level design is also cool and atmospheric.
But the game has two main flaws.
As far as difficulty is concerned the game is very well balanced.
Overall undying is a great game.
Definitely one of the best fps out there.
And it is by no means a tearjerker.
But I mean that in positive ways.
This is a complex documentary that shows many things about early Gay life.
A love expressed in ways that only true love can be.
This is the finest film ever made to deal with the subject of AIDS.
Cannot believe my eyes when read quite a bunch of other comments and reviews.
Loved every single bit of it.
Here it is different.
It does not spoil the atmosphere to me.
Very thankful to our Russian industry for the releases of classic Jackie Chan movies.
Thank you for attention.
The Direction is good.
Rest of the cast do OK i guess.
This review is for the extended cut of this movie.
I have always found the storyline a bit confusing.
The pacing is also better and overall it just works better.
Not much has carried over from the first film though.
We see various scenes where their silly schemes backfire.
This film is notorious in that it failed expectations at the box office.
The thing that really saves the film is the ending sequence.
The barn they fight in is full of clever little prop gags and improvisations.
The movie is a rare blend of a good vs.
The movie has its serious moments.
What I really loved about this movie is how it ends.
Let me just say it truly captures the spirit of the movie.
This game was really great and quite a challenge.
This film has to be viewed in the right frame of mind.
That leaves us with the comedy.
She welcomes them inside and they stay with her until the storm passes.
The film Torrent was a first and a last for Greta Garbo.
And leads quite the scandalous life there.
She has a political career in mind for her son.
Unfortunately for Torrent it came out one year before Oscar made his debut.
MGM were unsure of how to market Garbo when she first arrived in Hollywood.
Mack Swain plays her father.
Leonora and Rafael meet but Leonora is full of ridicule.
The dam is bursting and the torrent is flooding the town.
Rafael meets Leonora just before she is about to tour America.
Again he intends to go with her but again he lets her down.
It is certainly a good film with a positive message to follow your heart.
She returns to her home to visit her family and eventually confronts Rafael.
The ending is true to life and pulls no punches.
This film was quite a surprise.
There is one utterly fantastic line in this film that just says it all.
The sets and costumes were magnificent.
Without his magnificent abilities she would not have been the success that she was.
This is probably one of the worst movies ever made.
But I'm glad to have watched it.
Thank goodness he has grown up.
It takes at least three viewings to sorta figure out what the plot is.
My friends and I reenact entire scenes.
You will thank me for it.
This is undeniably the scariest game I have ever played.
Why she never became a bigger store may never be known.
A very enjoyable time over all.
The poster from this film rests on my bedroom wall.
My interest in international cinema has expanded since I first saw this film.
4 and I could have such a surprisingly delightful enjoyment.
Good acting and good scenery.
He takes the day as it comes and leaves tomorrow to its destiny.
But the show is almost completely stolen by Erika Anderson.
A delightfully campy and seamy riot.
New York I Love You is full of love and power.
The diversity from one story to another is creative and unique.
Eagerly waiting Shanghai I Love You in 2010.
I saw this movie at an advance screening and found it excellent.
They all give stand out performances in one way or another.
It also has serious stories and notes.
But that is good in my opinion.
Then the father quits his job at the law firm.
The youngest son gets a panic attack.
I do not know.
I liked the quiet conversations under a dark light.
I liked the intimate feeling of the show.
I liked the acting.
I admire the story.
Then I find myself wanting a second season of The Days.
The two have nothing in common.
So I hope fans will stop comparing them.
I just saw a press screening of this film and I was pleasantly surprised.
Over all the film is a great place to take a date.
especially if you are already fond of the city itself.
I can not wait for the next in the Cities of Love.
I gladly walked out with all my expectations met.
There were four amazing ones out of all the good ones.
Those four I will start talking about.
What I love is the ongoing surprises.
Most of the story presents the sad side of the capital city.
It shows many different nationality background.
I always liked Wright Penn and now I'm also a fan of Chris Cooper.
I'm not a writer or an critic.
I'M just a student that has seen this movie few minutes ago.
but it touched my heart.
it is easy and accessible.
Look at all the time that we have but we miss it.
and it has a special taste in New York.
It remains the sum of its parts.
The film is definitely uneven and has a very experimental tone.
It might be worthwhile for some and a waste of time for others.
It is just disappointing to see the city shortchanged on its heritage like that.
You will never know until you see it for yourself.
I'm just giving you a very vague heads up on what to expect.
i loved cooper his insight through out the show was just great.
he was by far my favorite character.
it was a great show I'm gonna miss it.
Running makes them all feel truly alive.
The entire 2nd act of D.
I have to agree that it is wildly original.
And it does not stop.
It is erotic and funny at the same time.
This is one of the movies that get better every time you see them.
This was a real show depicting family values.
Lorne Greene was dominant as the patriarch of the family.
His words depicted wisdom.
He reared wonderful sons.
His career never took off as he was associated as a Cartwright son.
He should have tried to get back into the series.
He certainly lost a bonanza by dropping out.
Bonanza had a great cast of wonderful actors.
It also made many of their best stories into great western drama.
Most of the shows before 1970 are pretty good too.
Even the worst of Bonanza is better than a lot of other TV shows.
I love Adam the best.
I already own the first one.
PLEASE MAKE ALL 8 MOVIES.
Because I have grown to love the actors who have played the characters.
PLEASE MAKE ALL 8 MOVIES.
We do not get that enough anymore.
Its more than its longevity that says a lot for this series.
I remember repeats of this series.
Lorne Green had his defining iconic character from this series.
Its appeal was across generations.
All members of the family could enjoy this.
The swatch was EXACTLY rectangular.
as is the seam in the coat.
Indians are not played by Native American actors.
The Bonanza producers could have easily done so thirty years later.
That is a major nitpick for me.
I do not think Pernell Roberts ever got the credit he deserved.
Many of the stories trace real historical events.
The guest stars were interesting.
I just watched an early episode that dealt with these 2 subjects.
But every writer should have some leeway with the truth.
But that is if Bonanza were done today.
Ben Cartwright was THE ideal TV Dad in any genre you want to name.
Just the popularity that Bonanza has in syndication testifies to that.
Pernell Roberts as oldest son Adam was written out of the show.
His sudden demise after surgery left too big a hole in that family.
household during the era in which it was viewed.
Bonanza is still infinitely re watchable in re runs.
Ben is portrayed as a successful and noble man of great integrity.
This is a wonderful action packed western with great values.
I lost my father at a very young age.
Over the years I have learned many things about him.
I can remember this as though it were yesterday.
U will not understand nor enjoy these movies.
Now about Loves Abiding Joy.
I knew HE was bad news from the start of the movie.
This movie has a lot to do with Jeff.
it is 6 years later so you know he will be interested in Girls.
I want to say that I have enjoyed all 4 movies so far.
Was not crazy about the books.
Cant wait until the next movie.
The way Clark talks will get you every time.
I would love to see January Jones do an appearance.
Maybe a family reunion or something.
This movie is wonderful.
It always has been always will be.
I'm mean really what is better then a house maid falling in love.
Walt really out did him self here.
This is only type of movies that i still have patience to watch.
But there is a one big shame.
You will have to see the movie if you want to know why.
At the ball she meets the handsome Prince Charming.
The characters are memorable.
I do not think I need to tell you the story.
For it has been told for years and years.
So I will just share my feelings.
I first saw Cinderella was when I was five years old.
From then on I was a Disney child in a good way.
Thankfully I was born before that so I was introduced to this classic.
Which is the true magic of Disney.
I feel they made necessary changes to make this a good Disney film.
This is a film very much to be watched with other people.
Immediate family is not good enough.
We loved the movie.
I am a mother to two little men.
I do wish we saw more of the Davis family.
We both wish actors would not change.
The new actors were good replacement tho.
My 9 year old son loved this movie too.
asked me to go buy them all.
He is a movie critic so for him to say this tells me something.
Family should all see this move buy it for friends .
Help bring back a time of values.
We will be Reading the books now that we are hooked.
really hope to see more.
Be Blessed happy moving.
And it really deserves its status.
But there is a Fairy Godmother on hand.
The animation and art direction is lovely.
The characters are also a delight.
Then the King orders the duke to find the women who wore that slipper.
This film is about a magical fairytale.
She never works for her dreams that she sings so fondly of.
Cinderella is a wonderful heartfelt story with a ton of musical highlights.
and thanks to Mr.
the chance eventually comes when the prince of the kingdom needs a girlfriend.
I think all the characters are portrayed amazingly.
The mice are funny and sweet too.
I do not think it is the best Disney film.
But it sure is a true classic.
Disney creates a magical adaptation of the classic fairytale.
I can watch it over and over again.
The music really fit the movie perfectly.
The cartoonists depicted the spoiled behavior very well.
I recommend it to everyone.
I have finally found movies that are good to watch.
The 12th animated Disney classic is a reasonable movie told through a simple story.
This was an important movie because it saved Disney from a delicate situation.
I love his voice.
The Grand Duke is a very cool chap and funny too.
The Prince is certainly one of the most charming in Disney.
The villains in the form of step sisters are perfectly evil and vile.
If you think about it Disney movies can really lost their charm.
In this film it is even more the magical when her rainbow comes smiling.
And of course the rest is.
A lot has changed since then.
Something about this movie just evokes the magic of Disney.
Any child or family members will enjoy this wonderful and magical story.
She cleans and cooks for them without ever receiving thanks.
You can not help but fall in love with this masterpiece.
That criticism is just.
It DOES look good.
The animation varies a bit.
I wonder how he put up with the animal.
Their actions are of maximum interest only in the light of the main story.
Among the supporting cast the notable humans are the King and the Grand Duke.
They remain among the most popular animated films of all time.
The result was enchanting.
And indeed he had.
It simply has never looked better.
I recommended it for a pleasant time of entertaining.
AS there where few scenes of downtown and the city center.
This two songs that have the same melody.
but people do not usually realize that.
I love all of the movies by Michael Landon Jr.
This movie kept me spellbound from start to finish.
Before watching a movie I always try to gather some previous information.
The second one is a psychiatrist that is assigned the treatment of the detective.
The movie is very fun and funny and it has superb moments.
It seems the script suits perfectly to the actors and vice versa.
Weird characters in a delightful comedy about friendship and heroism.
I love Paul McCartney.
I was upset to say the least.
It was almost as good as being there.
Paul is still the man and I will enjoy this for years to come.
I do have one complaint.
I would of like to hear all of Hey Jude.
Also Paul is not dead.
This movie was uplifting story of the loss and restoration of faith.
This is one of the finest music concerts anyone will ever see and hear.
I have a huge 5.
This is the closest you will get to a Beatles concert today.
I was glued to the set this entire show.
Thanks to this video I was able to enjoy it.
Only then does the second film start.
Then we shift to Southeast Asia.
This is a blimp we are talking about.
Just a fun film to watch.
Proud member of the Naval Airship Association etc.
I saw it about 15 years ago on HBO and loved the movie.
The place was packed both times and people had to be turned away.
The One and only was a great film.
Those who get the joke and those who do not.
People usually attack what they do not understand.
This film has a comic style and charm that has been unparalleled since.
and a GREAT romance.
A perfect movie for someone who wants a good lighthearted laugh.
There is no Justice in the world.
Sometimes with age people lose their sense of humor.
I love his impressions of Mr.
I saw this for the first time when it came out in 1984.
I still think this is very funny.
This came out in 1983.
Eddie made two stand up comedy films.
I preferred Raw because I just found the subject matter to be more humorous.
T and singers such as Michael Jackson.
Believe me your fans will love you for it.
And I think you know that.
I laughed myself sick the first three times I watched it.
At his best when telling stories from a kids point of view.
There are a lot of things wrong with it.
Just download it or something for cheap.
SO HINTS ARE VERY WELCOME.
Murphy has some pretty raunchy jokes but this is just too funny to pass.
If only every movie could be this funny.
If you ever see a stand up comedy movie this is the one.
You will laugh nonstop if you have any sense of humor at all.
This is a stand up standard.
It never loses its edge.
If only Eddie Murphy were born 10 years later.
Then we would all remember it.
But even I was only 4 when it came out.
It really needs to be watched more then once to understand all the jokes.
I have never seen a man be more funny than Eddie Murphy.
This is definitely one for your video library.
But the actors turn the dialog into something that makes sense.
You can see real people behind the unreal lines.
And the directing is wonderful.
The friends enjoyed it too.
There will be no other comedian like Eddie.
His imitations of Mr.
i was in tears.
if only i was there.
I think this still is the best routine.
Just long enough to last 20 years.
I just love how he allows the audience to be totally themselves and unrestricted.
This is hands down the greatest stand up show ever.
You can even tell the crowd gets really into.
He is SO funny.
brigade would find this hilarious.
His timing and delivery for his stories is almost unequaled.
It is THAT funny.
I have never seen anything like it.
I have seriously never laughed so hard of anything my entire life.
was but still laughed.
That is what it comes down to.
It is funny as hell.
T being a homosexual.
You look mighty cute in them jeans.
No one was expecting the filthy mouth that he unleashed on them.
But the results were just awesome.
Normal kids do not do shit like that Gus.
He was something never before seen.
He was all we ever needed.
Truly one of the funniest routines of all time.
Makes other so called comedies like dead boring.
It portrays incredibly cruel treatment of humans and animals.
Boy was i mistaken.
However as soon as the film started the laughs started erupting from my belly.
I was surprised with the amount that I was absorbed in this film.
All in all an excellent film if you are a fan of unnecessary comedy.
s the evil rich guy.
8 out of 10.
Very possibly one of the funniest movies in the world.
Pure stroke of genius.
10 out of 10.
I have seen it so many times I have stopped counting.
Trust me on this one.
There was no point in putting this great actor in this movie.
Sometimes I just want to laugh.
a definite must see for all comedy fans.
i like coop he rocks i gotta go bye bye thanks for reading this.
Sublimity is the way we have to reach for The Beauty.
And sublimity is the stuff this film is made of.
This movie is not as funny as South Park but it is pretty funny.
The slap stick style humor mixed with Stone and Parker just works flawlessly.
Recommended to anyone with a good sense of humor.
They create a new sport that combines baseball and basketball.
A definite recommendation for those of you who like slapstick and rude humor.
There are dozens of funny moments to this fantastic movie.
Robert Stacks Unsolved Mysteries spoof is also very amusing.
and everything else associated with nature.
Trey Parker and Matt Stone are absolutely brilliant.
So I'm keeping it professional.
This movie is just funny.
But this is different and just focuses on being funny.
After shaming them the sport goes pro in about a year.
I thoroughly enjoyed this flick.
if that makes any sense.
The opening prologue is brilliant.
it has a really genuine message that is conveyed through literal comic genius.
I gave this movie 8 out of 10 stars.
5 out of 10.
And it succeeded admirably in doing so.
This is the weepy that Beaches never was.
You almost wish people like this really existed.
Here the major theme is class division.
Stella is a story from depression era America.
Fans of the original never gave it a chance.
You get the drift.
A man sees her dance at the bar.
They like each other.
Stella ends up pregnant.
Stella tells the guy the news.
She sends him packing.
Everything is right about it.
I bought this while I was playing chess in Hastings.
I am from Denmark though.
It is very good.
Definitely with an understanding of the horror genre.
The monster towards the end is very scary.
The narrative is pure Golden Age.
The caricatured policemen fall hopelessly for the bait.
There are even dogs.
The public enjoys immensely about guess the murder.
The mystery is very clever and the denouement both complicated and interesting.
Enjoy a great Classic from the past.
The cast is terrific.
The film starts out incredibly in a beautiful Gothic castle in Germany.
Political correctness flies out the window in every episode.
Lee and Peter Mine.
Fortunately they assigned suave William Powell first to the character.
James lee as the abused Chinese servant is excellent and intelligent.
The story breaks into four parts.
Cracking good yarn with all the actors giving great value.
William Powell looks wonderfully relaxed and at his debonair best.
A forerunner to the Thin Man series.
But because it happens so fast and is .
This one is definitely a keeper.
it is all here.
Few things escape Vance.
He uses his wits to piece things together.
Also pleasant is seeing a few other great faces.
The unflappable William Powell.
This is a little hard to take.
If you add the fact that B.
Make no mistake this is her picture.
Miss Hepburn in particular benefits from this love.
Van Dine were most popular at the time and the clever Mr.
This movie is by far the best film adaptation of his works .
The plot is intricate .
Highly recommended if you are fan of this type of movie.
The cast is a great ensemble.
William Powell exhibits true star quality.
He is a joy to watch.
Mary Astor does above average work in a not very meaty role.
Mary Astor is very lovely here.
It gives the movie a baroque quality.
Its comedy at its best.
At more than one occasion the entire audience laughed loudly at a joke.
This movie also contains a bit more violence than the first one.
Although the movie was great all in all.
and of course no classic is complete without Audrey Hepburn.
I was a fan for life from that moment on.
boys on their global quest.
Of all the U.
She should have been told to stay at home.
I would love to know how Solo and company escaped from THRUSH H.
Bacall fits that part here.
Great Classic 1945 film without Humphrey Bogart.
The big distraction is the complete disregard for authentic accents.
It was hard to keep straight which country people were from.
I really liked the black and white cinematography.
The lighting also does a great job of adding to the intrigue and tension.
Bacall is just gorgeous.
But I still really liked this picture.
There is great tension and it moves along well enough.
Her one scene where she laughs maniacally as Mr.
This film has its good and not so good points.
The two have no chemistry.
Definitely worth seeing even with its flaws.
It could have been a better film.
This movie is perfect for all the romantics in the world.
I'm sure I have met Arthur in my travels somewhere.
I have to buy this one.
It could have been better had it been directed by someone with more experience.
I have loved it since local channels used to show it.
Graham Greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century.
Some pretty bad movies were made from his novels and stories.
Lauren Bacall is appealing as the British girl who falls for him.
And Wanda Hendrix could break the hardest heart.
She comes across as a precocious early teenager.
The character wants to be helpful.
She does her best.
I recommend this movie highly.
But the story and acting can scarcely be bettered.
Bacall lights up the screen of course and Boyer is entirely engaging.
They do not make movies like this any more.
Name just says it all.
We see a frail 82 year old Gen.
The film then goes into an almost two hour long flashback on Gen.
Told to leave he island for Australia before the Japanese military invade it Gen.
MacArthur achieved his most brilliant victory as well as his worst military defeat.
Truman who had taken just about enough garbage from Gen.
Truman unceremoniously relived Gen.
Back to 1962 we can now see that Gen.
One thing that Gen.
In that it is the soldiers who have to fight and die in it.
That must have been a subject they avoided.
The film opens with MacArthur addressing the student body in 1962.
Roosevelt and Harry S.
Roosevelt was a man who got his points across with unusual subtlety and cleverness.
Along the way it need not have ever come to a crisis.
Watch the newsreels and see if you do not agree.
Gregory Peck dominates this film even more than George C.
This movie had a good dose of them.
This is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies ever made.
The best thing is the laughter never stops.
All in all I was rolling with laughter throughout the movie.
The box is so cool and the music is very good.
Its hard to explain but it just feels like it.
The music even sounds like video games.
The acting is really terrible.
I watched it some years ago.
This may not be casualty.
This is simply the funniest movie I have seen in a long time.
Macy is excellent as always.
Pretty good acting performances by the cast.
Macy is excellent as the depressed Alex.
The story was rather flat and cliché.
I recommend you to watch it if you like mature interesting movies.
This is a haunting movie.
His mother breaks her promise and tells his father about the psychiatrist.
This is not the kind of drama that plays well in a movie theater.
Screwball comedy about romantic mismatches in New York City.
At one point Alex tells his doctor that he rarely gets angry.
This movie displays the kind of ensemble work one wishes for in every film.
What an amazing performance from a child.
She is fantastic as a wild young woman who is wise beyond her years.
Macy is the most refreshing little actor I have seen in awhile.
The cinematography creates the mood along with a very subtle musical background.
Very fine acting by all.
A sleeper that deserves wide attention.
I really liked this film.
One of those rare films that Hollywood Really does not make anymore.
It earns it is praise.
Everyone is either loving or hating this film.
I am going with loving.
It is so well shot and so well acted.
This film is for people who appreciate well crafted film making.
What a surprising treat to come across on late television.
But the film works.
The look and feel of the film is perfect.
I gather from reading the previous comments that this film went straight to cable.
And the use of restaurants in the film was fascinating.
Macy and Donald Sutherland.
I laughed and smiled all the time.
In a movie about the choices we make and the consequences we live with.
The impact stays with you right after you leave the theater.
This is the kind of movie Hollywood needs to make more of.
Just people dealing with being people.
I recently caught up with this little gem of a film on cable.
One always wonders about the secret life of hit killers.
He has to see someone to help him find peace with himself.
In going to Dr.
One of the best things in the movie is the late John Ritter.
He is equally convincing as Dr.
He is a natural actor in everything he does.
She shows a capability and range that are incredible.
He shows a maturity beyond his years.
Macy is such a great actor.
I highly applaud the casting of Tracey Ullman as the neglected wife.
Almost everyone knew what they were doing.
8 out of 10.
I am absolutely crazy about the show.
I think the entire cast is excellent.
That is really sad.
I hope they will bring it back .
Hope Davis really shines in this show.
I like the idea of SIX DEGREES.
It really makes sense in this insane world.
gone are the days of endless taping.
This was an excellent show to watch with a great cast.
Why can not the networks get it right.
I have complained to ABC about the cancellation of six degrees.
This deserves a 12 out of 10.
An absolutely refreshing show with real characters and real stories.
The scenery is amazing and wardrobes are exquisite.
They are all great.
It seemed like all the actors are personal friends in real life.
The characters are all likable and you root for them.
Big kudos to all the cast.
The show audience will mostly record it.
The new stream media will gain more and more popularity among viewers.
Six Degrees we will miss you.
Which is apparently a bit too late for the eager networks.
Everything here no one really needed to know.
This show showed great promise.
This show is totally worth watching.
However this show was believable with likable characters and marvelous story lines.
I do not think this show was given enough time to gain an audience.
I believe that given more time this show would have done very well.
Once again ABC is not giving a show with real potential a real chance.
I really loved the characters and looked forward to watching each episode.
Some things are just worth saving and this show is definitely one of them.
Even the kids are great.
So sad that it is gone.
Of course I wonder about the reasons it was canceled.
There is no way I will let myself believe that Ms.
It was in the perfect time slot in this market.
I have watched all the episodes again on ABC.
Put season one on video and sell it.
I was a loyal fan of Six Degrees and waited for it is return.
I set my recorder to tape all of the shows.
Thank God for that.
I just found out that the show was canceled and I'm heart broken.
The writing was pretty good also.
This is the best and most original show seen in years.
The more I watch it the more I fall in love with it.
I personally like every character.
There are so few shows I watch anymore as most TV is awful .
I am so sick of reality shows I do not watch any of them.
Now I want MORE.
WAY too much drama.
I can not seem to get enough.
Get some respect for having a QUALITY drama out there.
This could be one of the best shows of all time.
If somebody will just let it.
Six degrees had me hooked.
I thought it was just on hiatus and would be back early in 2007.
We could relate to the characters who had real problems.
We talked about each episode and had our favorite characters.
This show was Fabulous.
Even Jonathan Cake the philandering boyfriend was likable.
Some of us are not sheep.
i hate how we never find out how everyone ends up.
I loved the entire cast too.
I wanted to see what would happen to Laura or Damien and everyone else.
This is really such a downer.
It may be mild action but it is action.
Once again every member of the cast fits perfectly.
Matt Damon will forever be Jason Bourne.
How they do it I will never know.
Only his inhuman resilience leads the film a little too far into fantasy.
Its all about the action.
A scene set in Waterloo with a Guardian journalist does this to great effect.
This movie was excellent.
They never treat the audience like idiots.
All the actors were solid in their performances.
I recommend this film and the trilogy.
This sequence got repetitive and ultimately dull.
This installment very much makes the CIA look like a very foolish organization.
These sequences add realism to the film in feeling.
The third and last film of this trilogy is finally crystal clear.
It is a political film more than a plain entertainment.
So go and watch the film.
These scenes proved effective because of that approach.
And the action scenes are rather impressive.
I would been waiting for this since before they started filming.
Identity and Supremacy both flowed gracefully between adrenaline rush action to introspective drama.
This movie felt choppy at times.
That caused the following action to feel too frenetic.
All the martial arts training the actors went through was totally wasted.
Get some interesting shots.
They thrust new names and faces upon you from the get go.
Felt rushed or compressed for time reasons.
After you catch up however the story is quite good.
I thought that was awkward.
Obviously there are only two originals left.
Bourne and Nicky Parsons.
Them teaming up was kind of odd to me.
The other assassins in the movie were pretty quiet.
Those scenes were phenomenal.
The cast in general has degraded as the the series went on.
Clive Owen was practically an afterthought.
Felt like they wanted to get the series over with though.
It was my understanding this was the conclusion.
I thought that was going to be it.
A full circle type of ending.
I did like Nicky reacting to the news report though.
Look at what they make you give.
The final scene was great.
This movie is awesome.
He is this role.
Excellent film all in all and a fantastic ending to an amazing trilogy.
Nothing like his quietly heroic Edward R.
and physics in general.
The story seems to pick up right where the first film left off.
The cinematography is in your face following tight on practically everything.
Just leave it alone.
As talented and versatile as Matt Damon is.
it seems as though he was just meant to play Jason Bourne.
It sticks to what works and adds a little more.
The fights between Bourne and the assassins are always fun to watch.
If you choose to watch The Bourne Ultimatum without watching the previous 2 installments.
This allows you to appreciate and enjoy the movie even more.
Matt Damon was simply fantastic as his role as Jason Bourne.
I look forward to seeing more of his movies in the future.
I wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown.
I also thought Rachel was terrifically fresh and funny in these scenes.
I think Rachel showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant.
And she did it with an authenticity and freshness that was totally endearing.
I hope it brings a flood of great roles her way in the future.
I also hope it brings her an Emmy.
All I have to say to that is.
He really becomes Jason Bourne in this installment.
So I went out and bought both the original movies.
And what a surprise it was to me when I was gripped by them.
Because of this I was first in line today to see the Bourne Ultimatum.
The supporting cast of the movie were also absolutely outstanding.
But running throughout the movie is a very well written and well acted storyline.
This storyline concludes in the best way imaginable in this movie.
Well the action in Ultimatum has to be the best of the Bourne series.
In fact the movie kicks off with an action sequence in Moscow.
There was a lot to worry for when the Bourne Supremacy came out.
The stakes were raised and the story was enhanced because of it.
No one could have done it better than Matt Damon.
This is the first 10 out of 10 that I have given any movie.
This shot effectively captures the mood of the film.
The pacing is just incredible.
Ultimatum is its peak.
He has been running for too long.
Matt Damon delivers possibly his best performance to date.
He has the conviction and swelling desire of the troubled assassin.
There are some intelligent humor here and some fine suspense.
The audience was loving it.
All of the goods and then some.
The best of the trilogy.
This is how summer movie thrillers should be done.
I love the Bourne trilogy.
I do not hand out ten star ratings easily.
I think it adds to the suspense.
I loved this movie.
now they wished they had.
I have all of the original 120 episodes on VHS.
Now this movie will join my collection.
Thank You for the reunion Adam and Burt.
And it really manages to captivate your attention for every minute.
I'm a Belgian and grew up in the sixties.
I even got the View Master slides.
I had an urge to see the caped crusader.
All kids need some kind of hero.
They play themselves as they played their parts in the series.
I'm gonna watch it again.
I really enjoyed this.
I watched this last night with low expectations.
I'm glad I did.
It was pretty good.
Adam West and Burt Ward reunite as themselves.
This is told in flashback.
It was well done.
I loved this movie.
now they wished they had.
I have all of the original 120 episodes on VHS.
Now this movie will join my collection.
Thank You for the reunion Adam and Burt.
I'm making a copy for my kids right now.
It was very well done.
This downgrades the accuracy of the flashbacks needlessly.
There are many kinds of reunion shows.
These have mixed results.
New characters are introduced who do not fit the mix.
The Adam West of the movie is a man demented.
The whole thing is extremely funny and done with great panache.
The movie builds to a fairly obvious but funny climax.
I am Black American and I loved this soap opera.
This soap opera was the best soap opera EVER.
They are all alright.
It is the kind of sitcom that grows on you.
The humor is usually very mature too.
She looks good without make up too.
Take a trip back to the greatest time in American history.
This is one of the better comedies that has ever been on television.
Season one was hilarious as were most of the following seasons.
The only good part of the final season was the finale.
A large amount of the show revolves around how their relationship is working.
Kitty is just the opposite.
Bob also annoys Red to his full extent.
This is when the characters are beginning to feel new things for each other.
It is a basic continuation of the First.
The Third Season is my favorite.
It went back and captured the First Season feel and humor.
The Fifth Season is the last season I enjoyed all the way through.
The Fifth Season also had the best ending out of all the seasons.
The Sixth Season is good for the most part.
The Last Season flat out sucked.
I hated the Eighth Season up until the last episode.
It is up to you if you want to buy Season 8.
This show is wonderful.
It has some of the best writing I ever seen.
This show appeals to the young and the young at heart.
I love this show.
I'm not completely sure why.
Not this one though.
They even went to school sometimes.
The following seasons the character where fledged out.
I enjoyed seeing the two characters interact because they are the most different.
Last I will say that the casting of guest actors were always great.
This show is a great history story.
Even down to homosexuality.
She is so desperate to be loved that she destroys everyone around her.
Although I would love to see the unedited version.
The humor is what keeps the show eternally watchable.
They constantly play gags on the Point Place residents as well as each other.
Too bad that that show is on bad time for me.
He got these glasses which h are brown.
We all know what he does when his alone.
He wants to get laid badly.
He even had it with his boss in one episode.
His one big pussy.
Donna is one hot girl.
But I wish it would come back and make more episodes.
The show was absolutely hilarious.
Those were the best episodes.
It will be and always will be the best show ever.
It was really sad when the show ended.
They should make new episodes.
No other show does camera tricks like this.
Overall this is a very funny sitcom.
They are both great characters and always have something funny to say.
She really showed her acting talent before heading to Broadway.
This show has been a delight with many surprises.
and the series lets you forget all that.
I am about three years older than the kids portrayed in the series.
Then there are the parents.
I absolutely LOVED this Soap.
It has been one of my favorite.
I can not wait to see it again and highly recommend it.
Hope you all like it as well.
I do not know how you can like this show.
I would give it 4 out of 10.
before going out doing something they will regret later.
I was so sad they took the show off air.
This was one of the funniest and greatest sitcom to hit national television.
Season 8 was the real problem kicked in.
Season 8 was a little dull but the finale was excellent.
This show has come so far.
They stuck with the show and it was a success.
This is a cute and sad little story of cultural difference.
There was something honest about it.
Rarely does an independent film leave me feeling as good as his did.
A very promising first film.
An imagination is a terrible thing to waste .
especially when you have talented actors.
Anyone who has shared an apartment with a slob will be crying with laughter.
Cross Eyed is a rare gem.
Despite the tiny budget Adam Jones manages to give the film a serious look.
I can not wait to see what he comes up with next.
I had honest laughs.
Just keep going and be who you are.
Dreams are what you make of them.
Hope to see more.
Even the peripheral roles are well written and well acted.
Adam Jones has a brilliant sense of humor.
Cross Eyed was beautifully shot.
Cross Eyed gives hope to every low budget film out there.
That you do not have to spend a lot to create something worth watching.
There is something to like for everyone.
If you have had a terrible roommate.
if you have ever picked on a dork in high school.
if you have ever parked anywhere in the city.
I can not wait for his sophomore effort.
It is only a matter of time before Jones strikes again.
Without that a comedy is just a bunch of ideas.
They sneak up on you.
In this sense the film breathes.
Stepping between reality and surreality IS one of the points of this movie.
The dining room scenes are an absolute HOOT.
Put on your seat belt.
The standouts where the actors.
I also really liked the vigilante duo.
Well done to Adam Jones and crew.
The audience loved this movie.
Cross Eyed will keep you laughing throughout the movie.
Definitely a must see.
George meets and falls in love with the sweet and virginal Dr.
George regains his health and goes back to work.
Worth a look for those seeking something different.
It was really surprising how good this one turned out to be.
The beautiful doctor seems OK with this arranged marriage.
It is simply how it is done in her world.
I was surprised to find myself so engrossed in this operatically tragic tale.
I imagine many viewers were a bit frustrated by all this drama.
I was especially impressed by the extra attention to details.
He has a whole miniature forest built out of these amazing trees.
When i finally got it i found that the video version was longer.
voted ten against all averages for my age and sex.
my summary describes it best in very few words.
I find this movie very enjoyable.
Turns out to be very nice.
Romero can be a bit frantic here but Niven becomes hilariously bemused throughout.
I was having just about the worst day of my life.
But it is really so much more.
The plot is actually quite clever and creatively woven.
Time to watch this movie again.
This is without a doubt the greatest film ever made.
It will all become clear.
the white subtitles tend to wash out and become invisible.
This movie is amazing for several reasons.
Harris takes an extremely awkward documentary and turns it into a relevant social commentary.
He struggles to gain acceptance within his own community to no avail.
There is nothing that I know of that resembles this film.
It is its own genre.
I doubt that anything like it will ever be made again.
And it only gets better with age and repeated viewings.
This is how i felt while watching this film.
Another one of those fact is stranger than fiction pieces of film.
A film not to miss.
I have not seen anything else like it.
conflict with each other.
But some actors portray totally different characters.
Sorry to keep on blabbing.
Once upon a time in a castle.
And Evelyn almost uses the dagger against Kitty.
The grandfather intervenes and the worst is avoided.
They were sisters and hated each other.
But he assures them that this is just an old legend.
This is the very beginning of the film.
There are many twists and surprises in the film.
This is a great Canadian comedy series.
You will be glad you did.
10 out of 9.
TV how TV should be.
I loved this movie and will watch it again.
Original twist to Plot of Man vs Man vs Self.
His eyes conveyed more than most actors words.
I really liked this movie.
Kurt gets angry and kills everyone.
Please note that the below mark is only a guide.
7 out of 10.
I have to say I quite enjoyed Soldier.
Russell was very good as this trained psychopath rediscovering his humanity.
Very watchable and nowhere near as bad as I would been led to believe.
Yes it has problems but provides its share of entertainment.
Interesting mix of comments that it would be hard to add anything constructive to.
This was a very good action film with some great set pieces.
You will note I specified the genre.
I could go on but I have made my comment.
If it is not quite as outstanding an artistic leap as W.
SOLDIER is not as bad as many have made it out to be.
The costumes are like something from a mad max movie .
I fell in love with this silent action drama.
Kurt Russell and only Kurt Russell could have played this so well.
I miss the fact that sequels were never made.
3 or so stars.
I have my reasons.
The portrayal is spot on.
Fear and Discipline we are told.
There are many other subtle themes.
Watch Soldier with an open mind and see what it teaches YOU.
This is a great movie.
The story is very well done and there are no holes.
Jason Scott Lee being one of them.
For a while he lives there but can not adjust to normal life.
The military starts realizing this and Todd kills all of their men but one.
Russell obviously comes out on top.
This has everything you could ask for in a film including some great lines.
Which in a lot of ways are still relevant to today.
Interviews done by a young woman named Lena.
Essentially they are parallel films.
thanks for your time.
I have not seen Soldier 2 but this one it one of my favorites.
Both sequences are quite gripping in different ways.
And you know what it worked.
I do not remember this film getting a cinema release over here.
I only saw it when it came onto cable.
It is almost a mime performance.
David Webb Peoples meets Paul Anderson.
I do not think you will be disappointed.
The Barefoot Executive and his John Carpenter films.
The actors are maybe not so handsome or beautiful but they do act beautifully.
I think this film could make it abroad as well.
I thought it was an extremely clever film.
One of the best Finnish films ever made.
Half a dozen short stories of varying interest enlighten us about life in Finland.
This indicates that the events depicted happen at the same time.
The film improves so stick with it.
The last moments with his wife are both convincing and moving.
Movies like this are good to feed your imaginative power.
I was particularly impressed by two episodes.
This movie has it all.
every type of crime movie archetype character is here.
Truly a great film loaded with laughs and great acting.
I saw this movie with my dad.
It was on Star Movies one afternoon.
It really caught pace after the first half hour.
I can watch this film anytime.
A perfect comedy for a lazy afternoon.
And i remember almost every scene that was in the add.
All star cast trying to commit the perfect bank bust but nothing goes right.
It has enough action and laughs to sustain it.
A perfect laid back Sunday morning movie.
Had never heard of it previously.
A great combination of cast and writing.
This movie needs your full attention.
The humor is mostly in the dialog.
I believe my next viewing will probably be about my 12th.
I like this film for several reasons.
One of the best ones is DISORGANIZED CRIME.
This does not always guarantee anything.
Unfortunately it is a truck carrying manure.
It gets it is meaning across.
The plot is tight.
The acting is flawless.
A lot of comedy involved is them feeling each other out.
He gets the drop on O'Neill and escapes.
Murphy would have written.
She stores every bit of information she collects in an enormous archive.
I like to think of it as much more than that.
This film is a buried treasure.
Give it a try.
Pretty remarkable if you consider the context.
These two characters would not have had much to do with each other.
Like an old friend.
Definitely worth seeing if you get the chance.
Every scene was put together perfectly.
This movie had a wonderful cast and crew.
He has the ability to brighten up any movie with his amazing talent.
This is a movie with a good sense of feeling.
Chances Are uses that marvelous song by the same name throughout the film.
is excellent in this movie.
You will enjoy Chances Are.
I have just seen this movie for the second time on television.
Yet it is executed to perfection.
I thought it was a wonderful plot.
She has a sexy maturity.
is so charming that he melts the screen.
Even his smile is infectious.
Nay Sayers of this film are likely bitter from some seriously unrequited love.
Chances Are had me back a few good times.
I also watch the synergy between the cast.
I thought they worked well together.
you will have to find out for yourself.
by matter of opinion.
You really want to know how things are going to work out.
Enter Robert Downey Jr.
I do not know the answer.
But I do know that you need to see this movie.
It just gets recycled.
A charming romantic comedy.
Suffice to say it is worth seeing.
and Cybill Shepherd are in top form and enjoying every second of it.
He is told he can return to earth but not as himself.
The film is a little on the predictable side.
A lovely and charming fantasy that will engulf and enchant you.
I hope I can find it at a local video store.
I would highly recommend giving it a try if you find it somewhere.
I first saw this movie when I was about 10 years old.
This is really not an ordinary horror movie.
It has some horror elements but I rather categorize it as fantasy.
I liked it but I hoped for a bit more horror and scary scenes.
Now to the plot.
This movie is about a young girl named Anna who gets ill.
She makes a mistake and her father is looking very angry on the painting.
And next time she falls asleep the horror begins.
Her dreams became a horrendous nightmare.
The doctors thought that she fell into a coma or so.
There were a few thing I did not understand in the movie.
First of all it was the ending which I absolutely dislike.
It almost ruined the main horror scene.
I liked the boy.
The actor was awesome.
He was even better than Anna.
Overall a good movie.
I give it a 8 out of 10.
This is a wonderfully written and well acted psychological drama.
I also appreciated the absence of Dr.
Phil psychobabble or New Age revisionism.
The first such scene is very realistic.
I especially thought Charlotte Burke was really excellent here.
Great story and characters.
The only exception for this film was the ending.
It is definitely a keeper.
I heartily recommend it to those who appreciate the stretch of their imagination.
But none where satisfactory.
So Anna decides to draw her father in.
But I have found what I was looking for after 2 years.
While you may find this puppy in your horror section it is anything but.
A much deserved Burnout Central award only seems proper for that performance.
Drawings have never been scarier.
everything starts getting really weird.
The bits with the father are really terrifying.
There seems to be a lot going on in this film.
I love things like that.
This is a way cool fantasy movie.
She really does give a great performance in this film.
A very emotional experience indeed.
I would read numerous reports on its widely touted controversy and explicit sex.
This touch gives her even more believability out necessity.
I can not more highly recommend this thought provoking piece.
Be prepared to invest much thought in this deliberately paced film.
Very unusual fantasy with some truly terrifying moments.
But if you are game for something different this fits the bill.
This film opened to poor showings in the first few weeks.
Such a film of beauty that it is hard to describe.
The music and dancing is of the highest possible quality.
The ultimate homage to a great film actress.
The film is a masterpiece of poetry on the screen.
Like great poetry it is timeless.
There are many details you miss the first time that deserve a second look.
A great film requiring an acquired taste.
Even then it comes second to this masterpiece.
Their music and cinematography leaves you spell bound.
It reveals new layers to you every time you watch it again.
A parody of all the dreams you have ever had.
The film is visually overwhelming but also emotionally breathtaking.
In some scenes the strain definitely shows in her face.
This is not a fast moving film.
Great viewing for art cinema lovers.
This is a great film.
The Hollywood epic films are good.
However suitable for Homer pathos and existentialist reflections.
Bette thrills us with her jokes and brings us to tears with her ballads.
Spanning generations of people she offers something for everyone.
She possesses what it takes to keep an audience in captivity.
Her voice is as beautiful as ever and will truly impress you.
She gives her all every time she is on stage.
I will treasure this concert for a very long time.
In love with Burlesque.
especially if you are a baseball fan.
Many people would enjoy this masterpiece if it had at list the English subtitles.
I found this film to be a good family film.
I recommend this picture for the entire family.
Check them both out.
Somebody mastered the difficult task of merging sports with romance.
I never thought it could be done.
but I do like sports and most movies about sports.
This movie was a pretty good mix of the two.
This was a very good movie that could appeal to many.
I can not recall ever watching one.
I also do not recall watching a Jimmy Fallon movie.
She just captivates me that way.
I could smell the atmosphere of Baseball.
I thought the ending was a little abrupt.
I think Fever Pitch will help him out a lot.
It does not spoil the story telling.
Among the cast Irene Pappas as Penelope is the most recognizable to North Americans.
The love is between the two young lovers.
He is funny enough and gets the most laughs.
Barrymore on the other hand is the same old Barrymore.
Mike Leonard September 05.
I would say it will be a classical romantic comedy.
I have to say I was favorable impressed.
The movie shocked me.
Personally i had herd mostly bad buzz.
The best thing about the movie is it is consistency with the relationship.
but this movie did not follow that mold.
I will simply say i like it.
I have to admit that I went into Fever Pitch with low expectations.
I was already preparing some cheesy baseball puns for my review.
But it is real.
This is a great movie for the true romantics and sports lovers alike.
Drew Barrymore is at her best in this movie.
Louis and it is a happy ending all around.
Fever Pitch is a fun enough movie.
You do not have to be a fan to enjoy this film.
7 out of 10.
While the ending borrows heavily from O.
I saw this movie on Thursdays night after having a really boring day.
Why can not I meet a cute nerd like that.
Sunday on a Thursdays.
Probably the fact that we do not have that sport here in Norway.
I rate it a 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy.
Add one point if you are a baseball fan or romantically involved with one.
That says something in itself.
We expect that from her and she delivered.
But Fallon is the nice surprise in this film.
Fallon delivers his lines with subtle perfection.
But the town council afraid the raw methods carried out by Clint .
The highlights are the burning at Saloon and the climatic showdown at the ending.
Watchable results for this offbeat Western.
The entire film is very well shot and the cast is very enjoyable.
They personalize perfectly the characters.
This film makes a strong comment about the Italian people of the time.
I love them both.
Preparations for historical appointment with Mussolini.
The meeting of two different worlds.
Refuge for a mother with a sad life.
Short filling for a classical victim.
A story about solitude and silence.
A pleading for a ineffable relation with reality.
And with your interior world.
They are both excellent actors and play the main roles of Antonietta and Gabriele.
The movie covers a span of a few hours.
Most of the characters grapple with issues related to their own sexualities.
He acts as a real man who does not beg for pity.
When I read the original many years later I experienced that same sensation.
Then both develop a very enjoyable relationship in spite of their differences.
An unrelentingly passionate romance between two conflicting characters.
Magnificent performances from two pros make a splendid movie well worth seeing.
The film won deservedly Golden Globes 1978 to best Foreign Film.
The reason for that I will not reveal.
Antonietta feels what we feel.
We see how she does her hair to look attractive for the man.
Loren plays the scenes very good as well.
This is a movie you should see.
Our two heroes are not invited for the feast of virility.
She thinks she should be happy.
One of the last shots shows her listening to the news on the radio.
I like many things about the film.
it is a true gift.
This SPECIAL DAY is truly special.
A wonder of refinement.
There already are excellent comments dealing with these aspects.
I want to comment on the formal setting of the film.
She has to stay at home since the family can not afford a maid.
There is one exception though.
The film really takes off when these two people meet by chance.
This is a beautifully crafted movie with two of the most talented actors ever.
Loren proves here that she is an actress of caliber when well directed.
Entirely shot in natural locations in the Mediterranean.
The cast is brilliant and international here.
Strange that he was never offered roles of this dimension afterwards.
There were not many versions of the Odyssey before or after that.
Perhaps I missed something during the coarse of the series that explained that part.
Both of these are more epic than anything I have ever seen or read.
I highly recommend this.
The only merit in the film is that earth does face overpopulation.
A later film like Escape From New York is an obvious progeny.
In this movie the year 2022 looks much like the seventies.
8 out of 10.
The human race breeds like roaches with no outside influence to curtail it.
the human race still multiplies like bacteria in a petri dish.
6 billion and growing.
One can only hope to ever achieve and retain such humility themselves.
This film shows what can be done shot on video.
Both Charlton Heston and Edward G.
There should be more scenes of what they do to people.
How people act in 2022.
Even if you still know what the secret is it is a great movie.
Not often have i had the feeling of a movie it could be visionary.
But clearly this movie has the seed of a premonition.
A snapshot of ourselves at old age.
The only people who can live in comfort are the rich.
Great scenes with Edward G.
TV is a good wash brain.
Since writing all stop.
If you like reality show this movie is not for you.
If you believe all politician same too.
You are almost choked by the stench from the city and its filthy inhabitants.
The characters are wonderful.
The polluted air outside looks disgusting and very nasty.
The empty city streets filled with the vile and putrid people are very unsettling.
Many a film buff and environmentalist believe this is our eventual history.
The first is a food executive named William R.
At the time it was actually a huge box office success.
It was actually at least fifteen years ahead of its time.
If you look closely you will see everything usually makes sense.
After that it was all overblown disaster epics and big budget crowd pleasing trash.
Environmentalists always hail this film as showing the consequence of global warming.
We have exhausted the planet and we have to eat our dead to survive.
This was the farewell performance of Edward G.
And what the heck is going on between Heston and Edward G.
Just when you thought you would seen everything .
The film begins with a murder and a subsequent investigation headed by Charlton Heston.
Robinson in his final screen performance as the crusty sidekick to Heston.
I never would have thought it.
I prefer more vulnerable heroes.
I can understand why some people would turn their noses up at this movie.
had a twelve film Charlton Heston retrospective.
Their chemistry together is wonderful.
I just wonder why this film has not played in theaters all these years.
Its reputation should be better.
All of which makes his key scene in the movie all the more poignant.
Several things make this film a classic.
The story is solid.
The music is absolutely perfect.
This was the icing on the cake for the film.
Directed by Emilio P.
Still I was never bored.
As a camp classic I give this an 8.
It could have been much worse and it often was.
I can not say more without spoiling things.
They certainly do not make movies like these anymore.
Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give solid performances in this beautiful but empty film.
The irony is that Dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life.
well I'm not sure.
I can not help but think he would have been wonderful.
She looks great and wears some terrific clothes.
I heartily agree with the other reviewers who rave about the Technicolor.
Aubrey Smith as a wise old priest.
THE GARDEN OF ALLAH was the first Technicolor film to be shot on location.
Selznick finally gave in.
The remainder of the film was shot on a Hollywood sound stage.
I loved This Movie.
the Movies is about some serial killer killing off four girls.
I discovered this film after reading the book that inspired it.
But I found the primary appeal of this movie to be aural.
This is easily a 9.
He is the perfect psychopath.
A movie certain not to be forgotten soon by the viewer.
Just got out and can not believe what a brilliant documentary this is.
Rarely do you walk out of a movie theater in such awe and amazement.
This film was amazing.
It is an inspiring piece of cinema.
This film id a true example of man vs.
nature and sometimes man vs.
The inner turmoil and triumph is tremendous in its subject matter.
This film sheds light on a particular culture that has never been showcased.
I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival.
But it was so much more.
She sends him a letter inviting him to come and visit her students.
Although this is technically about blind Tibetan kids climbing Mt.
Her look over her shoulder at her Iraq tour was .
God Save our country.
Pleases help me with this.
If so who would I contact.
I will gladly pay for the privilege providing it is a legitimate link.
Thank you so much for any help you can offer.
These are NOT fatal flaws of the film.
What this movie further shows is a truth common to all wars.
This film illustrates the costs to the men and women perfectly.
A more balanced point of view would speak to a larger audience.
I am reminded of my father and his brothers returning from WWII.
For one of my uncles the war was never over.
For him the memories not only lingered but tortured him.
The tag line from the Vietnam war film Platoon says it all.
I saw this film tonight in NYC at the Landmark Sunshine.
I gave it an 8 only because it had received such low votes.
this is definitely really about a 5.
that sometimes gets old.
It also portrays the effect that killing has on the human psyche.
Now the conditions may be better in most of those countries.
at least on some level.
Darkness in Tallinn was made in 1993.
He has tried his best to infuse as many possible doses of Estonian humor.
This is why one can call it a comedy film of political undertones.
A nice film to watch on a sunny day.
I first saw this at a foreign film festival.
RENT OR BUY IT NOW.
This film is a wonderfully simplistic work.
I would recommend this film to anyone.
Some genre films need to be dressed up.
This one was an exception.
He invites her out to dinner.
This incident scars her.
They strike a friendship.
He also does drugs and Maya starts using as well.
In other words introduces her to a different world.
Rosario Dawson portrays the role with focus and endurance.
This film deserves an award.
I hope this group continues making films.
We already know what the film is about.
The creepiest being the opening scene in the morgue.
And the audiovisual maze was sinister.
I agree that this is an incredibly brave film.
This movie leaves the intellectual mind thinking and trying to analyze the story.
I too can not understand why people would trash this movie.
This movie presents high degree of realism.
I can not wait to get the soundtrack.
And hard to forget.
Too bad it was way too blunt for a widespread appeal.
I rented this movie simply because Rosario Dawson was in it.
Some people think they enjoy film but they are sadly mistaken.
Entertainment is rarely artful and even then only arbitrarily.
Descent is a film.
The film as a whole is beautiful.
All this accomplished by Rosario with facial expression and gesture.
The worst things that happen never leave you.
They are always in your thoughts.
They haunt you until that last thing releases you.
I have seen Irreversible and can understand the comparisons.
I certainly did and intently.
I'm 24 years old.
The way the film drags made it realistic to me.
not the act itself.
not the vengeance or the meaning behind it.
I had a great time.
I give the movie 7.
5 starts out of a possible 10 stars.
You can envision the typical college environment with wild parties and flirtations going on.
The photography in this film was excellent.
It appears like any other relationship in the beginning.
Both played this well.
Very innocent flirtation between the two.
He invites her to his apartment and everything falls apart.
The apartment is very dreary and dark.
This actually reminded me of a dungeon.
Here is where he shows his true colors and proceeds to rape her.
This is a very dark and gritty rape scene.
This scene is not for the young or weak at heart.
Maya now starts to lose her soul to drugs and sex.
She falls into her own abyss.
He is actually the one who introduces Maya to drugs.
They begin a relationship of dependency which comes into play later in the movie.
The club scenes at this point of the movie are photographed with extreme expertise.
What unfolds next is not actually whats happening.
She acts interested in Jared.
She appears to be looking to revive the relationship and be sweethearts again.
I was sitting there saying could this really be happening.
Nothing could be farther from the truth.
Now her apartment is dark and gritty.
She has him strip down completely.
She then teases him like any woman can.
This is where Adrian reenters the picture.
She thinks this is the final revenge.
It only makes matters worse.
I would just be a little hesitant if under 17 years of age.
The directing and photography must also be commended.
It was a night that I enjoyed.
Deadpan humor taken to the extreme.
I still hope to see this one again with English or Dutch subs.
A documentary without a loss for words.
A thumbs up if you are in the mood for something completely different.
At times the visual experiment here is as exhilarating as it can be irritating.
Considering it is his first movie he did a good job.
It should go pretty well.
The cast was great.
Surprisingly I thought Dylan McDermott gave the best performance as a homicidal cop.
I was really expecting a lot of cheesiness to be honest.
I would say it is worth seeing.
All the performances have a freshness and vitality about them.
He was great from the beginning.
Maybe the same is true of Spielberg.
There is no such a thing as perfect murder.
He kills his partner Jim Ferris who had plans on going solo.
And returns for one more question.
How he makes the omelet and everything.
Back for one more question.
At least that is the feeling this movie left me with.
His charismatic personality was highly infectious.
But this is still a great episode.
However it improved afterwards as the Valentine Party commenced.
The earlier murders are frustratingly devoid of gore.
He is a mystery writer who plots to perform the perfect murder.
The climax is the most disappointing aspect of this episode.
I am a big Beatles fan.
I was not disappointed by this movie.
The writers of this story knew these men very well.
I sat down to watch this film with much trepidation and little hope.
At times it seemed that Harris was channeling Lennon.
I am quite sure the Beatles would have come back together at some stage.
And I am quite certain that Lennon and McCartney would still be friends today.
I will watch it again and again.
this was a real guilt pleasure .
I still wonder why I watched this movie.
The ending was also very smart.
My favorite moment is probably the touching rooftop scene.
I remember how hard it was when John was shot.
I was impressed with his accent and mannerisms.
Jared Harris is also very talented and was quite believable as John.
What an AMAZING movie this was.
The comedic aspects of the movie were wonderful.
Worthy of at least an 8 out of 10.
But I was more than a bit pleasantly surprised.
You also certainly wondered how things went.
I do like the way most of the episodes focused on comedy.
scrappy was a breath of fresh air to the show.
Back to the show.
All the episodes and segments were very funny.
If you have never seen these episodes please do.
The character was tiresome and distracting to the story that was being told.
This show started out with great mystery episodes.
I think everyone is in the first 15 or 16 episodes.
Some of the voice actors became unavailable.
So they had to make more shorts.
I wish they were mysteries like 15 episodes.
Still it is a good show.
Valentine is now one of my favorite slasher films.
The death scenes are elaborate and the most of the acting is good.
The exception to the list of good actors is Denise Richards.
She was horrible in this.
Both films have a lot of smiles through the tears.
Both are Art movies that would get directly to the hearts of the viewers.
A film to live with.
It will display the overwhelming love of life along with human eccentricities.
It was packed with excitement and surprises.
Cactus and Terry win the titles in the end.
Big heat for Tyson.
R is even out of breath.
But at the Royal Rumble a new contender had emerged.
Stone Cold Steve Austin.
1 contenders for the tag titles.
I love this movie.
It was one of my favorite movies.
The action never stops.
The whole movie was done very well.
The ending is really good.
It was very original.
Whoever thought up this movie gets a standing ovation from me.
The acting was great.
Luke Perry did an excellent job once again.
I give this movie the highest rating.
The film has one Peach of a line.
This movie was pretty good.
This film is full of surprises.
The only thing that this movie had too much of was exploding cars.
Not as bad a film as i thought it would be.
It has a good cast.
Also a good use of unseen locations such as Luxembourg.
This film is underrated.
It was truly sweet and heartfelt.
Instead the issue is Victor is immature and needs to grow up.
It is very interesting and unsettling.
I'm surprised how many people give this move less than 7 stars.
But they just do not understand the movie.
The story is about growing up in a difficult situation.
There is a crazy grandmother who really wants the best for your grandchildren.
And the reason is because they understand the movie.
I feel sorry for the low scores given by some people.
I frankly do not have anything else to say.
Raising Victor Vargas is so true you will believe it.
This flick gets inside your head.
Raising Victor Vargas is a movie you definitely need to see.
It is so much like real life with what teenagers have to go through.
Thats how much feeling this movie has.
It made me feel real sorry for him like it was real.
The convoluted plot held my interest throughout.
A second viewing might just clear this up.
This movie works because it feels so genuine.
and thankfully not filled to the brim with cutesy pop culture references.
or as Bicycle Thief did.
This film is quite an achievement.
but Raising Victor Vargas is easily one of the best.
I have a feeling that this is a film that will be remembered.
although I have to admit that Bully was a cut above his normal fare.
Raising Victor Vargas is one film you will kick yourself for missing.
This movie feels like a film project.
Characters are kind of uninvolved and naive though.
This provides for some predictable but well done conflict.
A good watch but nothing stirring.
But I found nothing inauthentic or exploitative about these kids.
Let a thousand plastic flowers bloom.
He is a natural.
From a cinematographic I thought there was great use of light and texture.
This is just one of those films that is very culturally specific and particular.
True fans of film will love this authentic movie.
The dialog is great.
I felt that the natural lighting enhanced the character of the film.
Splendid supporting cast makes this a fun mystery to unravel.
I always enjoy Thomas Gomez.
His mad facial expressions made up for the off kilter stick sync.
8 out of 10.
is unsung hero of this and many movies.
A few twists that keep you moving.
But Curtis just seems to give up.
But the film survives this weakness.
People who do not like slasher movies will not like this movie.
As simple as that.
At least it does for me.
Cook deserved some acclaim for his frenzied performance.
Elisha Cook Jr was DUBBED in the movie.
The mopey bartender gives them both the eye as they leave.
Curtis is convicted and sentenced to die.
They visit the supposed witnesses again.
I laughed out loud.
Thomas Gomez is always reliable.
I do not know why it is considered as classic.
His use of shadows is quietly effective.
Glad I got it.
And the bartender remembers Scott but not the woman.
Neither does the cab driver.
There is some great storytelling done in the camera.
It is a terrific picture to look at.
I thought Tone was a little hammy.
is so delirious it has to be seen to be believed.
Another standout scene is when Kansas goes after the bartender to question him.
Some real good tension in there.
Sometimes these are the best kind of dates.
God knows why she stuck by him.
It moves quickly and just looks fantastic.
There are only a few flaws that prevent this from being perfect.
Tone gives a dreadful performance.
Also Curtis is stiff and bland as Henderson.
Also the last scene when the murderer is after her never rings true.
Still I'm giving this a 9.
This is definitely a move in the right direction.
Denise Richards stands out here as a fun character.
I loved her in this movie.
It may not even sneak into the top fifty.
Little by little she starts putting pieces of a murder mystery puzzle together.
You will know the scene once the last cymbal crash has finished ringing out.
Franchot Tone phoned this one in.
This is a film that will hook any viewer from the beginning.
The killer is not revealed until the end.
She holds her own against much more experienced actors.
This movie will not disappoint.
Nevertheless I was engaged by the hook of the Phantom Lady.
He is no stock villain.
Superb character actor Elisha Cook Jr.
The rest of the supporting cast is also more than competent.
I got it for Christmas after two months of dropping hints to my parents.
I am glad that I did that.
I would recommend this game to anyone from the age of 13 and over.
The graphics a pretty good in this James bond game.
One is Bond focus.
The other notable feature is the stealth and mêlée kills.
The basic game does have other flaws.
It ties in with the aspect that you are a deadly and ruthless spy.
I'm not a follower of a certain movie genre.
Unlike Urban Legends the screenplay and the story line is very weak.
Everybody has loved the soundtrack as far as I know.
I am glad I did.
It was very entertaining listening to Sean Connery and playing the game.
The only thing I might change was the upgrade system.
I really liked the Q copter.
I think the developers did a good job.
Pulley as Big Jule.
I find it to have a rather shrill quality.
I will not try to speculate as to what Brando was attempting.
Guys and Dolls has to be one of my favorite musical movies ever.
It is a very fun movie to watch and nothing more.
Big splashy film of the Broadway music.
The songs are all good and the dancing is incredible.
The real show stopper is at the crap game at the end.
Her song and dance numbers are definite highlights here.
I give it a 7.
The dialog is also unique in that no contractions are used.
A real joy is the MUSIC.
Not bad for a director with no experience in this type of movie.
Another quality is that it is fresh each time one sees it.
Frank Sinatra is that devilish Nathan Detroit.
Those dance and singing routines are fabulous.
She was pleasantly surprised by the singing voices of Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando.
Directed by Joseph L.
It would be easy to call Guys and Dolls great.
This is what the musical genre was made of.
Frank Sinatra was wonderful.
Nothing else needs to be said.
It is a true classic that can be appreciated at any age.
It connects with all audiences and makes you smile and laugh.
The storyline can be told in two sentences.
The acting is very uneven.
Delightful and very different.
Guys and Dolls is a movie itching for a remake.
Its two main stars are either dead or 409 pounds.
The scenes between her and Sinatra were obvious.
whatever it is called.
I really did not like the art direction in this film.
The fake Times Square was just so completely phony it drew attention to itself.
Jean Simmons shines as Sarah Brown.
I love this movie.
My only disappointment was that some of the original songs were changed.
I really thought Jean Simmons was perfect for this part.
I thought the movie was well cast.
A must for old school horror fans.
you have been forewarned.
I got cider in my ear.
wish some guy would sing like that to ME.
She really makes you feel for Adelaide.
maybe I like them equally.
One of the best things about this movie is their lingo.
Guys and Dolls is a unique play based on the characters.
Nathan ran a crap game in the missionary the night they were gone.
The songs in this movie are just wonderful no matter who sings it.
Vivien Blaine had a terrific voice and was the perfect Adelaide.
We watch a magnificent cast of characters that were typical of the area.
Some of the songs from the original production were not included in the film.
These were distinguished actors that could have made an amazing contribution.
The look follows closely the fashions of the times.
Frank Sinatra is good as Nathan Detroit.
Vivian Blaine is a delight.
Stubby Kaye makes a wonderful job out of reprising his Nicely Nicely Johnson.
Isle of Man locations.
They have a great website which is worth checking out.
I think all you people are expecting too much.
and that is my opinion.
I have seen this movie twice with my teenagers who love it.
Kathleen Turner shines as the stepmother.
The melancholy prince is a great departure from the typical swashbuckler.
Hopefully Blockbuster or Amazon will start stocking this one sometime soon.
this film was almost a great imaginative film.
This movie was an imaginative twist on the Cinderella theme.
Everything but production values.
And you can almost never say that.
Most films would never even expect such a thing of you.
The acting ties much of this story together.
I see myself in this.
I see how I saw the world.
I personalized and identified with his character.
I could NOT really feel sorry for these two.
Both did NOT deal with their problems effectively.
They really did NOTHING for the film and were totally ridiculous.
I felt his role should have been elaborated.
The players were just doing what they felt was adequate and sufficient.
I actually wanted to be a part of this family.
They were so realistic.
It is VERY depressing until pretty much the very end.
A horrible tragedy strikes a Montana family.
But they just can not.
Something is blocking this family from sharing their sorrows.
The story is very quiet and naturalistic.
These boys have apparently never taken a hunter safety course.
Second man then passes him the gun through the fence.
He does not even run for help after his brother is shot.
His family seems to shun him.
Perhaps they are even angry at him for killing his brother.
They really do not even try to talk to him.
The acting is hauntingly distant in most cases.
Some even may be advised to bring some tissues.
8 of 10 stars.
I do not think a movie like this would be released today.
The performances are all top notch and quietly nuanced.
I want to thank all of you who saw this movie and enjoyed it.
not to mention the affect everything had on my mother and little sister.
Harder even to believe that people were still watching it a year ago.
Our thoughts and prayers are with each and every one of you.
I first saw this when it premiered more than ten years ago.
I saw it again today and it still had a big impact on me.
I really like this film.
I think this movie should have been in theaters.
I enjoyed it very much.
Every character had an element of the color purple in them.
Good Job to all the cast and crew.
I thought this movie was good.
Plus a movie with Michelle Rodriguez is always good.
I finally watched it this week and what a delight.
Adrian and her coach were also quite good.
Another powerful chick flick.
That alone makes the movie worth the price.
Diana decides boxing would be a good way of focusing her anger.
I liked the relationship between Diana and Adrian.
Santiago Douglas as Adrian is excellent.
Watch how their emotions towards each other are shaped by the squared circle.
You could tell that she was a tough woman.
She is more a bad girl and that is what I like about her.
I recommend it to be seen.
Diana is a feminist.
The movie points out the problems some families face with gender.
I was a bit concerned with the ending.
I think it was pretty clear by the title that she would win.
Loved the score for some of the scenes.
All actors had chemistry on screen and made this movie even more amazing.
This movie is a real gem.
But I do not want to discourage people from watching this film.
I gave it an 8.
There are some remarkable performances here.
Check out this movie.
But I was wrong.
It just looked real I think.
but not by a girl.
Diana has trouble at school.
She just can not stay away from fighting.
At home her father is constantly putting her down.
But that is not at all what this is about.
That way you can deal with more problems at once.
How positive things can make you grow.
Also Michelle Rodriguez is very good in the lead.
I think she and Adrian were great actors.
Because of this movie I Am Boxing too.
It really impressed me.
the only negative part I think.
But you do not get to see how it is at home.
I had a great time watching it.
I really enjoyed Girl Fight.
It something I could watch over and over again.
Very convincing might I say.
She had so much compassion and yet so much hate at the same time.
Even though he loved her he was really hateful.
The love story was a part that i really enjoyed in the movie also.
I felt the passion the y had for one another.
I thought it ended just right.
After grudgingly doing so there is the problem of lining up matches for her.
Then the confrontation with her father when he finds out what is going on.
The plot is strait forward enough.
Diana almost literally changes from a girl to a woman.
She wants to box.
All Diana wants is to be treated like any other guy.
Not looked down upon because she is a woman.
She steals money from her father to begin training.
Santiago has been instructed to save it for his next bout.
With their narrow hips they can run faster.
And they have greater muscle mass and upper torso strength.
This sexual bifurcation is the result of the perfectly normal process of natural selection.
I speak to you as your anthropologist.
Douglas refuses to fight a woman in the ring.
And Rodriguez is offended by what she sees as his patronizing attitude.
